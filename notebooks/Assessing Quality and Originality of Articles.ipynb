      "The University of Missouri’s Southwest Research, Extension and Education Center (REEC) is poised to offer more public education and research opportunities with the addition of a state-of-the-art livestock handling facility. A groundbreaking ceremony was held Tuesday in celebration of the joint effort between the College of Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources (CAFNR) and MU Extension. “This one building is going to offer an incredible expansion of educational opportunities for our students, researchers and the community,” said Christopher R. Daubert, vice chancellor and dean of CAFNR. “Here, our students will get more hands-on learning experiences, and our researchers will have the best infrastructure to allow them to focus on what they do best — world-class research that is applicable on working farms throughout Missouri and moves the livestock industry forward. ”The facility, which will sit on the portion of the REEC north of I-44, will offer an indoor space for breeding activities like pregnancy checking, healthcare procedures such as vaccinations, and research data collection like blood draws. It will also feature an observation deck and add basic amenities like restrooms that do not currently exist on the portion of the nearly 900-acre REEC that sits north of I-44. “We are excited about this new investment at the SW-REEC,” said Marshall Stewart, vice chancellor for extension and engagement. “The beef industry is a vital part of Missouri’s economy. So, through this facility, MU Extension faculty will be better equipped to serve the needs of Missourians. ”In addition to conducting research, MU Extension uses Southwest REEC facilities to provide community education that helps area farmers improve practices and make their own farms more productive and profitable. “This is going to make our farm and our programs so much more accessible to the public,” said Jay Chism, director of the SW-REEC. “As a land-grant university, the ability to bring the knowledge of our researchers and faculty to the hard-working farmers of southwest Missouri is truly rewarding, and this facility will make even more of that work possible. ”Chism looks forward to offering classes through MU Extension to area farmers that the REEC currently cannot support. These would include topics like artificial insemination in which a live demonstration would be key to learning. He also looks forward to seeing students being able to focus more on retaining information and less on dealing with mother nature. He recounted a story of graduate students using blankets to shield themselves from a snowstorm last year when pregnancy checks had to be done. “There’s not a lot of education going on at that point,” Chism said. “You’re just cold and miserable. ”MU Extension and CAFNR are working together to make this $400,000 facility a reality, and the groundbreaking marks the beginning of this project. The facility is expected to be completed by June 30, 2023. In addition to Daubert, Stewart and Chism, attendees heard from Missouri State Sen. Lincoln Hough and Missouri State Reps. Mitch Boggs and Scott Cupps as well as Jim Spencer, Southwest REEC Advisory Chair. The Southwest REEC was established in 1959; the site represents various soil types in this region on Missouri. Serving 22 counties, the center addresses the main agricultural concerns of area industries including beef, forage, and horticultural crop production. \n",

      "As I sat down to write this final version of the White Pages, a wave of sentiments filled my head, but the one that prevails over the rest is gratitude. Since the day I took my first oath nearly 50 years ago to support and defend the Constitution of the United States as a young Marine in 1973, serving has always been more than what I do, it’s who I am. Your confidence in me is something I am truly grateful for, and I consider myself lucky to have had as many opportunities to serve as I have had in my lifetime thus far, from Marine, to guardian ad litem, to teacher, to the most recent roles as senator and assistant majority floor leader. During the 12 years I have represented our community in the Legislature, I have sponsored more bills that I can count. One that is particularly close to my heart helped deaf and hard-of-hearing children. During my first year in the Senate, it was brought to my attention that many deaf children in Missouri were facing the problem of not having access to hearing aids. The ability to hear affects every aspect of a child’s life, as it is essential for their ability to interact with others, learn and build a future for themselves. My chief of staff and dear friend, Mike Kelley, is partially deaf and unfortunately did not have access to hearing aids until adulthood. Together, we decided that this was a difference we could make. We filed and passed Senate Bill 43, which forced insurance companies to cover hearing aids for deaf children. As a result, children in Missouri no longer have to experience the isolation and suffering that those who previously could not afford or have access to this technology and coverage went through. Another topic that I am particularly attached to is protecting children from abuse and neglect. The heartbreaking situations I witnessed as an attorney with the Jasper County Juvenile Court cemented this passion for me. I sponsored legislation to improve our state’s adoption process so more children in Missouri would find themselves in safe, loving homes. I passed a measure to strengthen protections and provide more oversightfor children in unlicensed residential facilities. In addition, I sponsored legislation to allow child abuse investigations to occur after the statutory deadline, when good cause for failure to complete the investigation in a timely manner had been documented. The Marine motto, Semper Fi, has also been a driving force throughout my years of service. I have proudly chaired the Senate Seniors, Families, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee the past two years and carried numerous pieces of legislation to support veterans’ programs and resolve issues faced by our servicemen and women. I’ve also enjoyed speaking to several veterans groups at various events, especially my comrades and friends at Charlie 22 Outdoors in Webb City. The COVID pandemic touched every aspect of our lives and even had ripple effects in the General Assembly. I proudly sponsored legislation to safeguard health care workers and facilities from frivolous civil actions, and this past year, I ushered the Essential Caregivers Act across the finish line, ensuring people would never again be separated from their loved ones like they were during the height of the pandemic. Amid the hundreds of proposals I have carried, these are the bills and issues closest to my heart. Protecting vulnerable people is paramount to me, and I’m blessed to have been able to do that through my work in the Legislature. Looking back over these years and experiences, I am fortunate to say I would not change a single thing I have done to this point, not a single hour spent, mile driven or vote taken. I am closing this chapter of my life with my integrity and dignity intact, knowing that I always followed my conscience and my faith, keeping those I serve at the forefront of my thoughts and actions. I am truly excited for what lies ahead and will remain dedicated to helping people right here in our community. I am grateful for my patient and loving wife, Ellen Nichols, my family and each and every one of you. As I bid you farewell, know that I will be praying for our community, the state of Missouri and our great nation in the days to come. It has been the honor of a lifetime serving you. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — A slow first quarter by the Carthage Lady Tigers proved to be the difference in the 55-49 loss to Nevada Thursday at home. The Tigers faced a 14-6 deficit after the first eight minutes. “I was proud of our energy tonight, but our shooting let us down in the first quarter,” Coach Scott Moore said. “We can’t afford an off shooting quarter against a good team like Nevada. ”Lauren Choate scored 17 points to lead the Tigers with Kianna Yates adding 12 points. Lexa Youngblood chipped in with 10 points, Landry Cochran finished with six points and Zye Clark added four points. “We won the last three quarters, but it takes four quarters to put away good teams,” Moore added. “We saw some of our flaws get exposed tonight, we will get back to work in practice tomorrow to get those corrected as we start getting ready to make another run in the Pink and White Tournament after practice,” said Moore. The Lady Tigers are now 5-2 on the season. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — After a sluggish start over much of the first three quarters, Carthage was able to catch fire from behind the arc in the fourth quarter and pull away from Monett in a 58-44 win in the Tiger’s season opener Tuesday at home. The Tigers only scored 4 first quarter points, but were able to grind through the first half to trail 18-15 at the midway point. Carthage Coach Nathan Morris dialed up the pressure in the second half using a zone press to create several forced turnovers and scoring opportunities for the Tigers. Sophomore Trent Yates was feeling the hot hand, burying four 3-pointers in the deciding fourth frame to help ignite the Tigers late run. Yates would finish with 16 points. Junior Just Ray led the Tigers in scoring with 20 points. Senior Clay Kinder finished with 13 points, including two 3-pointers to go along with the barrage of fourth quarter 3-balls from the Tigers. Senior Max Templeman added nine points. The 1-0 Tigers host the 76th annual Carthage Invitational Dec. 8-10. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — High energy and a swarming defense propelled the Lady Tigers to a 63-24 win over visiting Central (Springfield) Monday night. “We had great energy to start the first half and the second half,” said Carthage Coach Scott Moore. “I love it when we come right out of the locker room and take it to teams. ”The Tiger defense held the Bulldogs to a total of eight points in the first half and allowed the offense to build a solid lead heading into the half up 30-8. “The girls have really started to gel as a team on the court,” Moore said. “They are great friends off the court and it’s awesome to see the benefits of that on the court. They are sharing the ball well, spreading out the scoring, and cheering hard for each other when they are on the bench. They are a really fun bunch to coach. ”Lauren Choate led the Tigers with a game-high 17 points including three 3’s. “Lauren had a good shooting night. She led a balanced attack that saw six players score five or more points for us,” added Moore. Lexa Youngblood also finished in double-digits for the Tigers with a career high 12 points. Kianna Yates finished with nine points, Jaidyn Brunnert added eights points, Trisha Kanas scored six, Maggie Boyd chipped in with five, and Ashlyn Brust, Zye Clark and Landry Cochran scored two points apiece for the Tigers. “When we are playing fast, sharing the ball and can get nine girls a lot of minutes, we are a tough team to stop,” Moore said.

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Scoring early and often was the name of the game for the Tigers offense as they took the lead from the opening possession and never looked back en route to a 70-48 victory over Webb City Friday night during day two of the Carthage Invitational. A 3-pointer from Senior Clay Kinder opened the scoring for Carthage and by the end of the first quarter the Tigers added three more 3-pointers to take an 18-10 lead. Senior Max Templeman used his speed and ball handling skills to penetrate the Cardinals defense all night and finish with a game-high 24 points including a perfect 11-for-11 from the free throw line. By the end of the second quarter, the Tigers had doubled up Webb 36-18. The Tigers got a scare early in the second half when Junior Justin Ray drove to the basket and was fouled by a Webb City defender, sending him hard to the floor. After a few minutes with the Carthage athletic trainer, Ray was able to walk off the court under his own power and eventually returned to the game in the fourth quarter. Senior Britt Coy finished the game with a double-double, scoring 13 points and grabbing 13 rebounds. Ray added 11 points while sophomore Trent Yates scored 10. Kinder added eight points. Sophomores Tyler Stevens-Diggs and Kruz Castor chipped in two points apiece. Carthage (3-0) will face Joplin (3-1) in the championship game at 4:30 p. m. Saturday. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — The Carthage Tiger Boys Basketball team started out hot in their opening game against the Ft. Smith Southside Mavericks Thursday at the 76th annual Carthage Invitational. Multiple three-pointers from Justin Ray and Max Templeman in the opening minutes of the game would stake the Tigers to an early lead and an eventual 20-12 advantage at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Tigers cooled off — scoring only six points — but their stingy defense would hold Ft. Smith to only six points as well, for a 26-18 lead at the halfway point. Ft. Smith made a run late in the fourth quarter pulling to within two points, but a series of turnovers forced by the Tiger defense and clutch free throws from Templeman, Clay Kinder and Trent Yates allowed them to come away with the 45-37 win. Templeman led the team with a game-high 18 points followed by Ray with 13 points. Kinder added 10 points and Yates chipped in with four points to round out the scoring for the Tigers.

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — The Lady Tiger basketball team scored 16 of their 44 points in the fourth quarter to seal the 44-34 win over the Olathe East Hawks during their opening game of the Carthage Invitational Thursday. “It’s always great to win the first game of your home tournament,” said Coach Scott Moore. “Olathe East is a well-coached, disciplined team who made us work for every point tonight. We came out with great energy to start the game tonight and that awesome when it’s the first time in front of the home crowd this year. We had a lull of execution in the second and third quarter, but then turned it back on in the fourth quarter. ”Sophomore Maggie Boyd scored 11 of her game-high 22 points in the final frame which included going 7-for-7 from the free-throw line and knocking down a key 3-pointer early in the quarter. “(Maggie) was hot from the three point line, mid range and free throw line,” said Moore. “That’s a triple threat from the sophomore. ”Senior Kianna Yates added 16 points for the Tigers and Moore praised her leadership and ball handling skills. “Yates gave us steady production all night and did a great job taking care of the ball when Olathe tried to press us late,” added Moore. “It’s a coaching luxury to have her handling the ball late in close games. ”Sophomore Lexa Youngblood added five points for the Tigers and sophomore Lauren Choate chipped in with one point to round out the scoring.

We can score in bunches when we get both parts of our game going like that. Limiting any varsity team to just 10 points in a half is pretty impressive. ”Sophomore Maggie Boyd set a new career high with 24 points to lead the Lady Tigers. Senior Kianna Yates and Sophomore Lauren Choate also scored in double-digits with 19 and 11 points respectively. “It was nice to have all three guards score in double-figures tonight,” added Moore. “That’s the first time that’s happened so far this year. That bodes well for us going into next week’s slate of games. ”Moore noted there is still room for improvement on the offensive side of the ball, especially from the outside. “Offensively, we still aren’t shooting the ball that well from the perimeter. Once we get our outside shooting where we want it to be, we will be a very potent team,” Moore said. Sophomores Ashlyn Brust and Lexa Youngblood had three points apiece and Senior Landry Cochran and Sophomore Jaidyn Brunnert finished with two points each for Carthage. The Lady Tigers are 4-1 on the season and host Central Monday before Nevada comes to town on Thursday. \n",

That allowed (them) to get out and run in transition, and kept us from getting set up in our full-court and half-court defenses. ”Kianna Yates and Lauren Choate both scored in double digits to lead the Lady Tigers. Yates scored 23, while Choate added 19. Ashlyn Brust and Maggie Boyd added seven points each. Landry Cochran and Jaidyn Brunnert added four points apiece and Lexa Youngblood finished with three points to round out the scoring for Carthage. “Kianna and Lauren were our offensive catalysts tonight,” added Moore. “Kianna had 23 points and at least 10 rebounds for her second consecutive double-double. She’s such an exciting player for all 94 feet of the court. Lauren has been struggling with her shot in the early going this season, but she picked a great time to come out of her slow start to hit 4 threes. ”Lady Tigers 32 vs. Bentonville 50The Lady Tigers saw themselves down early in the first quarter for the second consecutive game, but were unable to duplicate the comeback efforts in a 50-32 loss to Bentonville during their final game of the Carthage tournament Saturday. “A poor shooting first quarter dug us a hole we couldn’t climb out of today against a very tough Bentonville team,” said Coach Scott Moore. “We will work on our areas of concern in practice on Monday and get ready to take on Lamar on Tuesday. ”Maggie Boyd led the Tigers with 11 points followed by six points from Jaidyn Brunnert.

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Tuesday night marked the beginning of the wrestling season for the Carthage Tigers, and the 21st year at the helm for head coach, Kenny Brown. Heading into this year’s matchups, the Tigers may be feeling the absence of last year’s nine seniors, but as with most years, the biggest challenge, according to Brown, is keeping everyone healthy. Amidst a season of illness and the rigors of extended fall sports seasons, lineup changes can often be hard to anticipate. “Our lineup isn’t as deep as it has been in the past. The last several years, there has been a lot of competition in the room for my varsity spots, so when a kid would get injured, his replacement wasn’t very far off in ability. There is a larger gap in ability this year between my varsity and junior varsity kids, so it is vital to our success that our varsity remain healthy,” Coach Brown stated. Last year’s Carthage team was considerably deeper through the lineup, and more experienced, yet fell to Carl Junction in their home opener. Brown attributes tonight’s success to timing and circumstance and the boys’ ability to put up some extra bonus points. “We definitely had some circumstances fall our way, starting with the coin toss. We won the toss and were able to make it to where CJ had to report to the table first at 144 where they were planning on forfeiting. This allowed me to put one of our JV wrestlers, Joe Pantoja, into the lineup to accept the forfeit. By doing this, I was able to bump Kip Castor, our normal varsity 144, to 150 where he was able to get the pin for us. In essence, this was a 12-point swing in the team score. Carl Junction was also without their varsity heavyweight due to an injury suffered over Thanksgiving break. ”This young team did pull off some surprises in their victories, according to Coach Brown. “I don’t know that I would necessarily say there were surprises in the number of matches that we won, but I was surprised by some of the bonus point victories the boys were able to get for the team, specifically getting the pins from Alberto Sales(113), Trey Nye(157), and Alexander Salas-Marquez(215). All three are serving in their first season as the varsity starter at their respective weights. ”Without returning state qualifier Grey Petticrew, senior, and senior Davion King, last year’s 160 lb. state runner-up, the outlook for victory was in question at the beginning of the evening. It was evident, though, that the team’s morale throughout the dual never waned. Especially after Sales, Nye, and Salas-Marquez’s matches. “Alberto at 113 being able to get the fall with seven seconds to go in the match got us on the board and got the boys fired up. Trey was wrestling a youth state medalist who grew up wrestling in the Carthage Kids’ Club. I felt that Trey could get the win, but I wasn’t expecting a fall. Finally, Alexander getting the fall took the pressure off our 285(David Recinos) having to get a fall. When Alexander pinned his opponent, I knew that David just needed the decision for us to be able to win on tiebreaker criteria. At times when a kid knows that he must pin his opponent for the team to be able to win, they will put themselves in bad positions to give the team a chance to win. David knew he just needed the decision and wrestled a smart match by staying in great position. At 285, there is very little room for error, so not having to take unnecessary risks in the match was a great position for us to be in,” Coach Brown stated. Armed with his ever-present rule book, Brown was able to present the criteria established by the National Federation of High Schools stating that Carthage won in this instance. This criteria can evaluate up to seventeen different instances to determine the winner of a tiebreaker during a regular season dual matchup. In this case, the sixth criteria was the determining factor, as Carthage had no forfeits, and Carl Junction did. The National Federation of High Schools is also responsible for determining the weight classes for wrestling. This year’s weight classes have changed, with the intent of establishing a more uniform classification system for girls wrestling, as well. Not only did girls wrestling add another classification for larger schools (they are now class one and two), but they added two more weight classes, to be equal to boys wrestling at fourteen. The new boys weight classes are: 106, 113, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144 (was 145), 150 (was 152), 157 (was 160), 165 (was 170), 175 (was 182), 190 (was 195), 215 (was 220) and 285. The Missouri High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) also governs several aspects of the season in compliance with NFHS guidelines. Each season, MSHSAA redetermines district assignments and school classifications, as well as season start and locations for district and state competitions. Coach Brown, who has been a registered wrestling official since 1996, explains the changes. “MSHSAA reclassifies high school sports every year based on 9th grade to 11th grade enrollment. MSHSAA got rid of the private school multiplier a few years ago and now adjust private school classification based on a success formula. The better a private school does in a sport over a 6-year period can result in them being moved up one or two classes from where their actual enrollment would put them. This causes the classes to be much more fluid with more changes than we had grown accustomed too. MSHSAA has also added a 2nd class of girls wrestling this year, which is why the format of the State tournament had to change. The girls were originally going to have their own State tournament at Cable-Dahmer Arena in Independence this year, but due to a scheduling conflict with the Arena, they lost the ability to use it this year. Now, we are faced with having to have 4 classes of boys wrestling and 2 classes of girls wrestling at Mizzou Arena. To do it, they will have the Class 1 girls and Class 1 & 2 boys State tournament on Wednesday and Thursday. Friday and Saturday will be the Class 2 girls and Class 3 & 4 boys. As to how it will affect our team, it will require some minor adjustments. The biggest change for us this year is that Neosho has moved up to Class 4 and will be in our district again for the first time since 2018. They are a quality program and will definitely make our District tournament much tougher. ”Carthage has been a class 4 team (the largest class in the state) since the 2018-2019 season began. This puts them in direct competition with the other largest schools in the state, such as Liberty, Park Hill, Christian Brothers College and Seckman. Three years ago, Carthage started its own dual tournament over Christmas Break, to allow them to compete against more of these teams in one place. “This has turned into a very tough tournament, specifically with the addition of Liberty, who has won the last 3 State Tournaments in class 4,” Brown stated. 2022 State ResultsLiberty—1stNixa—4thHickman—5thCarthage—17thLee’s Summit—31stRay-Pec—31stThe class 4, district 3 competition consists of Carthage, Springfield Central, Joplin, Kickapoo, Lebanon, Lee’s Summit, Lee’s Summit North, Lee’s Summit West, Neosho, Nixa, Ozark, Raymore-Peculiar, Republic, Sedalia Smith-Cotton, and Waynesville. “I believe that Ozark is going to be the team to beat in Class 4, District 3. There will be some good competition, especially with Neosho moving up to Class 4,” said Coach Brown. Here are the Carthage Wrestling Results from our home dual with Carl Junction on 11/29/22. Carthage next wrestles in the Frontenac KS JV Tournament on Saturday 12/03/22 starting at 9:00AM. The varsity next wrestles in a double dual with Cassville and Berryville AR on 12/06/22 in Cassville starting at 5:00PM.

      "Instead of mailing its end-of-year donations from its charitable trust, First Community Church of Joplin opted for a more personal touch this holiday season. A morning reception at the church gave church members the opportunity to meet with community organization leaders and put faces to those relationships. “It takes all of us playing our part in people’s lives. It’s never just one agency,” said Dianna Gurley, executive director of Souls Harbor and one of the recipients. “It’s wonderful that First Community brings everyone in the community together to work as a team, to help move our community forward. ”On Monday, church members talked with these leaders around a decorated Christmas tree, holding cups of coffee and muffins. Russell Willoughby, minister at First Community Church, 2007 E. 15th St. , talked about the church’s charitable trust making these monetary donations. “It is fortuitous, with our charitable trust, that we make our primary disbursements at the end of the year and the fact that it coincides with the holiday season with the whole spirit of giving that is so prominent at this time of the year,” Willoughby said. “We thought the two went together very well, and it was an opportunity for us to support area agencies and celebrate this time of year by making these gifts. ”Recipients of the donations included the Lafayette House, Watered Gardens, Missouri Southern State University’s Lion Co-op, the Area Agency on Aging’s Meals on Wheels program, Souls Harbor, the Alliance of Southwest Missouri’s parenting program, Crosslines of Joplin and the Joplin Community Clinic. Willoughby said many First Community Church members work with these organizations, and the church supports several of them through means apart from financial donations. First Community Church believes that ministry comes in many different ways, Willoughby said, adding that serving the material and physical needs of others reflects the ministry of Jesus. “The name of our church is First Community Church of Joplin, and the “Community” not only defines us as a community of faith internally, but also we believe it has an outward focus to it,” Willoughby said. “We’re also here for the community. It’s our way of trying to walk in the steps of Jesus. ”During the reception, Laurie Delano, treasurer of First Community Church, gave some background. Established in 1993, the trust is overseen by three trustees. It started with small donations, and five years later, a significant donation by a church member truly started the mission. The trust uses income yearly to fund missions on behalf of First Community Church of Joplin, both locally and worldwide through Church World Services for things such as hurricane relief and for Ukrainian refugees. Many organizations said the timing of the donations, both during the Christmas season and at the end of the year, was needed. With the economy tightening, donations are down and needs in the community are increasing. “You know, whether a donation comes in that’s $5 or $50,000, it is remarkable to me to see how hearts are out there,” Gurley said. “They’re just out there, and they want to share with each other. The human spirit coming together in a project is amazing. ”Gurley said the charitable trust’s donation comes at a perfect time, when people need food from Souls Harbor the most. Also this month, the organization is filling Christmas baskets and giving away gift cards so children can get presents under the tree this season. Without state or federal funding, donations like this one from First Community Church are everything. “Everybody in the community who donates to us, that’s priceless,” Gurley said. “That’s what keeps our doors open. ”\n",

      "A 25-year-old man who fired several 9 mm rounds into another man’s vehicle on Range Line Road in Joplin has been handed a five-year prison term. Eduardo Macias pleaded guilty Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court to an amended count of first-degree assault in a plea deal dismissing a related count of armed criminal action and calling for the five-year term. Judge David Mouton accepted the plea bargain and assessed Macias the agreed-upon length of sentence for the Class B felony conviction. Macias had been facing a more serious Class A felony count that carries a punishment range of 10 to 30 years. Macias, who was listed on court records as homeless at the time of his arrest in the Sept. 4 shooting, fired about six rounds into a vehicle occupied by Maico Vazquez near North Range Line Road and Zora Street, according to a probable-cause affidavit. Vazquez escaped injury in the shooting, and Macias fled westbound on Zora in a car that was stopped by police a short time later at the North Florida Avenue and East Nashville Street. The arresting officer could smell alcohol on the defendant’s breath as he was being taken into custody, and sobriety tests administered at Joplin City Jail led to the filing of an additional charge of driving while intoxicated. The defendant’s girlfriend, who was with him at the time, told an officer that he had been exhibiting road rage, yelling at and “flipping off” other drivers before pulling up next to Vazquez’s vehicle and shooting at him without any apparent provocation, according to police. \n",

      "Joplin will provide $1. 5 million to a proposed project by Missouri Southern State University to build a $30 million Health Science Innovation Center on its campus. The Joplin City Council voted 9-0 Monday night to approve the contribution. The money will come from the nearly $13. 8 million the city is to be provided through the American Rescue Plan Act. Leslie Haase, the city’s finance director, said city officials prioritized a list of unfunded city projects that could be done with the ARPA funds. The MSSU project made the upper cut of that list, rated No. 20 of more than 40. An agreement between the city and university pledges the $15 million to the MSSU project if that amount can be raised. Council member Mark Farnham asked for more detail on the project’s funding status. “Obviously this is a big, expensive project, and $1. 5 million is not nearly enough for a project like this,” Farnham said. Dean Van Galen, university president, expressed appreciation for council consideration. “As previously stated, $15 million (for the MSSU project) was included in the state budget last year by the governor,” he said. “Our task is to raise another $15 million. Prior to a decision of the council this evening, we are at $6. 7 million (toward the university’s match of the state’s $15 million). A commitment by the city would bring us to $8. 2 million. That would leave $6. 8 million to raise to launch the project as currently envisioned. ”Financial commitments so far have come from businesses, charitable foundations and individuals, Van Galen said. “I think we are off to a very good start in terms of identifying and raising the money we need to make this project a reality and have good confidence that by June 2024 we’ll be able to reach that goal,” he said. But if the goal is not met, the city would be released from its commitment to provide the $1. 5 million, under the terms of the agreement. The health sciences building is one of the capital projects to receive funding from Gov. Mike Parson’s $470 million allocation in the state budget for building needs at the state’s colleges and universities. Van Galen explained in a February campus visit by the governor that Joplin serves as a hub for health sciences for the Four-State Area. The health science center would contain numerous rooms in a simulated hospital equipped much like a real hospital for services such as acute care, labor and delivery, emergency care and examination rooms. It also would have a radiological technology lab and numerous classrooms for teaching and conducting research. The council also voted 9-0 to support a resolution to accept a $5 million grant awarded to the city of Joplin by state legislators. Haase said grants were originally authorized for drinking water projects in 15 cities. However, the water system in Joplin is operated by a private company, Missouri American Water Co. She said the grant language also lists stormwater and sewer system projects. City staff is working with the Department of Natural Resources to determine if it has to be for a drinking water project or if it could be used on one of the other types of projects. If it has to be used for a water project, Missouri American would have to pay the match if it wanted to use the grant money. If it can be used for another type of project, city staff would likely recommend a wastewater project. The council will be informed when further information is obtained regarding how the grant would have to be used. Joplin also has been approved for a state grant program that could provide $1 million for work on the city’s justice center building at 303 E. Third St. The city would have to match that amount to obtain the grant. She said an update on the potential of that grant to provide for remodeling or repair needs of the justice center would be brought back to the council. \n",

      "The Missouri Public Service Commission will hold local public hearings next month, including one in Joplin, on water and sewer rate cases filed by Missouri American Water Co. On July 1, Missouri American filed water and sewer rate cases with the PSC seeking to increase annual water and sewer revenues statewide by $99. 6 million, or 25. 7%. Missouri American said it wants to recover nearly $770 million in investments it has either completed or planned between January 2021 and May 2023. If approved in full by the PSC, the bill for a typical water customer, defined as someone using an average of 4,200 gallons monthly, would increase $12 or $13 per month. The bill for a typical wastewater customer would stay about the same, and the bill for flat-rate wastewater customers would increase by $3 to $10 per month, depending on the service area. Missouri American provides water service to Joplin, but not sewer service. Current bills also include an adjustment for the Water and Sewer Infrastructure Act to help pay for some completed projects. Under the rate review process, these projects are reviewed and may be included in any new rates set by regulators. The rate request is expected to take up to 11 months, meaning new rates would not go into effect until late spring 2023, five years after the last change in base water rates for its customers, Missouri American noted in the announcement. HearingsThe PSC has planned both in-person and virtual local public hearings:The Joplin hearing will be held Jan. 19 at the Robert Plaster Hall Auditorium on the campus of Missouri Southern State University. The hearing starts at 6 p. m. , beginning with a public information/question-and-answer session conducted by the PSC staff, followed by the commission receiving testimony from the public. Other in-person hearings will be held Jan. 24 in St. Joseph and Jan. 25 in St. Louis. Virtual hearings are planned for:• Jan. 17, at noon. • Jan. 18, at 6 p. m. • Jan. 26, at 6 p. m. To attend a virtual local public hearing by telephone, at the time of the hearing call toll-free 1-855-718-6621, listen to the prompt and enter the access code 2455 943 6681 for the Jan. 17 hearing, the code 2456 839 5072 for the Jan. 18 hearing, and the code 2451 319 5401 for the Jan. 26 hearing, followed by # (pound/hashtag symbol).

Any person may comment at any of the hearings, but are encouraged to attend the hearing corresponding to the location nearest their service area for the most relevant information. Comments at all local public hearings will be limited to five minutes per person. Hearing information and participation requirements are also being mailed out by the company. Pump stationThe company said in a statement that investments in the rate case include the replacement or installation of 280 miles of water and wastewater pipelines, upgrading of treatment plants, storage tanks, wells, pumping and lift stations, fire hydrants, meters and more. Among those projects was the replacement of the high-service pump station building and its pumps in Joplin. The utility this spring received a building permit from the city of Joplin for a new high-service pump station at its treatment plant at 21st Street and Murphy Avenue in Joplin. The pump station will replace units in service since 1983. The project includes a new building to house the pump. The project is valued at $6. 6 million, according to the building permit, with completion projected for the end of the year. Missouri American also upgraded a series of water lines in the Royal Heights area of northern Joplin from 2 inches wide to 8 inches, and company officials have said other areas of the city were the focus of projects, including upgrades on the south side of town to be completed by the end of the year, and an area near Connor Avenue and A and B streets near Main Street set for 2023. The utility also has been replacing its lead service lines in areas where they still exist around the state. Missouri American Water is a subsidiary of American Water, the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing water and wastewater services to approximately 1. 5 million people in the state. \n",

      "A defendant who had been granted a suspended sentence in a 2021 shooting incident in Joplin has been sent to prison for possession of a firearm as a felon. Keontre D. Guster, 20, of Joplin, pleaded guilty recently in Jasper County Circuit Court to unlawful possession of a firearm in a plea agreement limiting the prison term he might receive to no more than four years. Judge Dean Dankelson accepted the plea bargain at a sentencing hearing Dec. 15 and assessed Guster four years for the conviction. He had faced up to 10 years as charged. Guster was arrested Aug. 10 when an officer responded to a report of a suspect in an incident involving a firearm the previous night being present in an apartment complex at 1502 S. Michigan Ave. According to a probable-cause affidavit, Guster was leaving an apartment as the officer approached, and a girl who was with him spontaneously informed the officer: \"The gun on him is mine. \" A search of the defendant's person turned up a handgun in his waistband. The defendant had been granted a suspended sentence the previous month on a conviction related to a shooting incident Sept. 23, 2021, in the 800 and 900 blocks of Moffet Avenue in Joplin. A probable-cause affidavit filed in that case stated he got into a dispute with James Smith and others, and fired a shot at Smith in one block before firing three more shots at him about a block down the street. Initially charged with discharging a firearm at another person, Guster pleaded guilty July 18 to a reduced charge of unlawful use of a weapon and was placed on probation, only to be arrested in possession of a handgun about three weeks later. \n",

      "Ready for another jab in the arm?Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week approved updated COVID-19 booster shots, which have been specifically tailored to combat the omicron subvariants now dominant in the Joplin area and most of the country. The new booster shots — one from Moderna and one from Pfizer — are the first updated boosters. Two previous booster doses used the same mRNA technology found in the original vaccine. The newest booster — the third produced since the pandemic hit American shores in early 2020 — is bivalent, meaning it targets both the original COVID-19 strain and omicron’s BA. 5 subvariant, which accounts for 89% of all current U. S. infections. CDC officials have approved Moderna’s updated shot for people 18 and older, while Pfizer’s updated booster has been OK’d for people 12 and older. To be eligible, people must have completed the primary vaccination series of two shots, and be at least two months out from the last dose of any COVID-19 vaccine, according to the CDC. Officials also recommend that people who have recently had COVID-19 should wait three months after testing negative before getting the updated booster. Joplin resident Michael Gregory, who enforced a strict in-house quarantine during the early months of the pandemic two years ago, said he looks forward to receiving the new booster in late October or early November. Gregory, a former schoolteacher and retired director of the Heartland Opera Theatre, received both his second booster and flu shot at the same time last year. He’ll likely do something similar every year for the rest of his life. “I think the boosters will continue to be more effective as time passes and scientists have more data to use in their development,” he said. “I feel scientists everywhere did a remarkable job developing the original vaccine in such a short time. The more we know, the better the result. ”A few hundred people continue to die from mutated versions of the original coronavirus each day in the U. S. , according to the CDC. The new boosters, the federal agency says, should make a sizable dent in those numbers in the latter half of 2022 and into early 2023. “The boosters are crucial to maintaining the general health of the world’s population,” said Gregory, who lost a sister and several friends from complications due to COVID-19 in 2020, before the vaccines became available nationwide. “We can’t let our guard down. ”Where to get a boosterAccording to the CDC, 48. 5% of eligible Americans have received their first booster shot, and 34% of those eligible have received their second. “I would encourage (the booster) if you have underlying health conditions,” said Larry Bergner, director of the Newton County Health Department. “It’s something you should talk to your physician about, to see what they recommend is best for you. ”The new boosters, as with all COVID-19 shots so far, are free. Walgreens and CVS began offering them late last week; check walgreens. com or cvs. com for details or to schedule an appointment. The Jasper County Health Department announced Tuesday on social media that it has received the new boosters and is scheduling appointments. The Joplin Health Department said Wednesday that it has ordered the new boosters but has yet to receive them. For individuals seeking the primary COVID-19 vaccine, shots will be available by appointment on Tuesday at the department, 321 E. Fourth St. “COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective and free,” Joplin Health Department officials said this week on social media. Freeman Health System and Mercy Hospital Joplin currently have no plans to administer booster shots via a drive-thru clinic, officials with both hospitals said Tuesday. \n",

      "In this weekly feature, we put five questions before someone in the community. Today, we chat with Annette Thurston, of Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Four States. 1. What is the 21st Annual Gift of Light, Gift of Love fundraiser presented by Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Four States?Gift of Light, Gift of Love is the charity’s biggest fundraiser of the year, and 100% of the event proceeds are used to operate the Ronald McDonald House of the Four States at 3402 S. Jackson Ave. and the Ronald McDonald Family Room at Mercy Hospital Joplin. Ronald McDonald House provides a “home away from home” for families of seriously ill children and ill expectant mothers being treated at Freeman Health System and Mercy Hospital Joplin. Our Ronald McDonald Family Room offers families of pediatric patients a place to rest and regroup just steps away from their child’s hospital room. It is a small oasis of calm and normalcy amidst the tense, chaotic medical setting. We opened up the family room in November 2017. This year, we have a 20-foot Christmas tree in front of our house, and our grounds are decorated with festive lights throughout the holiday season. The Gift of Light, Gift of Love fundraiser is now in its 21st year, and it was the vision of co-chair Gary Brown. It all started at Northpark Mall where we would light a tree and have performances by local area groups. Then, we moved the event to the movie theater, and we would have the lighting of the tree and a private showing of the upcoming movie, as well as performances by dancers. It was highly successful. It became an event where people would kick off their holiday by attending the annual Ronald McDonald House tree lighting. 2. How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the annual Gift of Light, Gift of Love fundraiser?With the pandemic, co-chair Amanda Mitchell had the idea of bringing the tree lighting outdoors to Ronald McDonald House at 34th and Jackson Avenue. We decided to tape the performances and upload it to our website. We have continued that tradition, and we’re now in our third year. 3. Who will be performing as part of this year’s Gift of Light, Gift of Love fundraiser?We have Karen’s Dance Studio, Missouri Southern State University’s Chamber Singers, Entrada Brass and the Dynamics group from Carl Junction performing this year. All of those performances are available on our website at https://donate. onecause. com/rmhjoplin. You can watch the videos, and our grounds will be lit nightly around 5:15 p. m. to 5:30 p. m. where people can drive by or take their pictures with the lights. Gary Brown has truly gone all out this year because he added an angel to the light pole, a reindeer and the ornaments at the bottom of the steps. This year’s presenting sponsors are Liberty Utilities and McDonald’s. 4. How much does the RMHC of the Four States hope to raise with this year’s fundraiser?This is our main fundraiser that helps keep Ronald McDonald House open and operating. Our goal this year is to raise $200,000. We’re very close to reaching our goal. We’ve raised over $141,000 so far. Last year, we raised $193,000. I think we’ll meet our goal this year. The generosity of people in our area is just outstanding. We never take it for granted. To put it into perspective, $200,000 can help operate the house and the family room program for a minimum of three months. 5. In what ways can the public get involved with the RMHC?There are several ways to give back to the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Four States. They can donate online on our website at https://rmhjoplin. org/donate. They can also sponsor a family staying at the house. Families are asked to contribute $10 per night but if that is not possible then their stay is sponsored. Contact our RMH program manager at 417-624-2273 or housemanager@rmhjoplin. org for more information. If they’re doing holiday shopping on Amazon, they can select to support the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Four States at no cost to them. Amazon will donate 0. 5% of the price of eligible purchases. For more information, visit https://smile. amazon. com/ch/43-1758397. \n",

      "A report on taxes compiled by a Missouri free market think tank concludes that Joplin has a “relatively high” per-resident rate among the state’s 20 largest cities. The bulk of the revenue is generated by sales taxes, which the Show-Me Institute report says is a volatile source of revenue that is “prone to dramatic swings,” especially in a recession when buying diminishes. While Joplin is the 13th most populated city studied, it ranked sixth out of the 20 for the highest sales tax collections per resident. “Voters have a say and obviously the people of Joplin are choosing a high sales tax rate and a low rate of property tax,” said David Stokes, the institute’s director. “It’s the voters’ choice, but in the long run it would be healthy to depend more on a more stable property tax. ”That echoes the position that City Manager Nick Edwards presented twice to voters, who were asked last year to approve property taxes first to revamp and expand Memorial Hall, and later in Proposition Public Safety to fund increased pay scales for police officers and firefighters. Both issues failed at the polls. In regard to the tax report, Edwards said it contains a lot of good data. “There’s a lot of work that’s been done and it provides a lot of information to the public about different taxes and the way cities are funded,” Edwards said. “The difficulty comes when you start comparing communities because it’s difficult to compare apples to apples the taxes that residents pay. You have to start thinking about the specifics of them, at least here where we’re a regional hub,” Edwards said. ”Citizens from other communities are also paying that tax. The sales taxes actually spread out across a wider base, so it looks artificially elevated when you do the comparisons,” he said. Joplin’s city sales tax rate is 3. 125%. When added to the Missouri sales tax rate of 4. 23% and the Jasper County sales tax rate of 1. 38%, the total becomes 8. 725%. South of 32nd Street where the city lies in Newton County and that county’s sales tax is higher, the total rate is 8. 975%. The city also has six special taxing districts where 1 cent in additional sales taxes is collected by property developers. Those are transportation development districts at 1717 Market Place, where added sales tax money is paying for street projects and the rate is 8. 850%. In community improvement districts for rehabilitation projects at Northpark Mall and North Point shopping center at 510 Range Line, the total rate is 9. 725%. On the Newton County side, community improvement districts collect a cent for developers to go toward extraordinary costs for constructing streets and other infrastructure for their properties. That pushes the total tax rate to 9. 975%. Those are in the Highway 166 district, Hope Valley district, and the 32nd Street Place district. “I think it’s well established that Joplin is primarily funded through sales tax, and I can’t disagree with any of the numbers they’ve presented but it becomes difficult when you try to compare communities,” Edwards said. Leslie Haase, the city’s finance director, said the report’s authors acknowledge that in the report. “What I do like about this is that it talks about the services provided. As I went through the report, if you look at the cities like Florissant, where there are services reported there are ‘noes’ checked all the way across the list. “What I noticed is the higher you are on the list, the more services that are provided,” Haase said. The report, and Stokes, say taxpayers get more services in Joplin than in some cities, such as a fire department rather than a fire district and subscription fire service. Joplin also has a health department that provides health information, vaccines and children’s immunizations, WIC nutritional services and other programs for women and children. While the city does not operate water or electric utilities, it provides a sewer system and has an airport with commercial flights. The report does not credit Joplin for having a city-supported museum or public transportation services. Stokes said that is because Joplin’s transit system does not offer as much service as bus systems in Kansas City and St. Louis. “Our secondary point for Joplin is the tax abatement numbers,” Stokes said. “We are very much opponents of TIF (tax increment financing) and subsidies. ”The report states that the amount of taxes abated in the year 2020, when the data was collected, is equivalent to 0. 05% of the of the total taxes collected that year. “This is low compared to the other cities, but it’s generally not great practice to give some businesses or individuals a tax break while others pay their fair share,” the report states. Haase said that in Joplin’s case the TIF’s and tax breaks that have been allowed have paid dividends with long-term returns on investments along with providing jobs and retail opportunities the city would not have had otherwise. Stokes said that by having a more broad tax base, the institute believes that keeps taxes as low as possible. But having examined Joplin’s audit report and Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for 2020, “Joplin’s overall financial health is good,” Stokes said. \n",

      "A rural Joplin woman took a plea deal this week granting her probation in what had been a felony child endangerment case. Alison G. Krug, 27, pleaded guilty Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court to an amended count of driving while intoxicated and was sentenced by Judge Gayle Crane to a year in jail with execution of the sentence suspended and the defendant placed on unsupervised probation for two years. Krug had been facing a felony count of child endangerment in connection with an arrest March 9 at the Tanglewood Apartments on East 32nd Street in Joplin. A probable-cause affidavit states that a police officer was called to the complex regarding a disturbance and made contact with Krug, who smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot eyes. She was leaning against a car with difficulty remaining upright, and her speech was slurred, according to the affidavit. The defendant admitted to the officer that she had driven to the location with her 1-year-old son in the car after having been drinking and using methamphetamine a few hours previously, according to the affidavit. \n",

      "Students in the Joplin School District last week wrapped up the fall semester, and with it, put an end cap on nearly 100 years of educational instruction at Columbia and West Central elementary schools. These buildings have faithfully served their neighborhoods for almost a century, and it’s time that they are retired. They are not well equipped to handle 21st-century learning, so students next month will start fresh in the new Dover Hill Elementary School. But what happens now with the old schools?District officials have said they would raze Columbia and either raze or sell West Central. In fact, the 2019 memorandum of understanding between the school district and the city of Joplin for the Dover Hill property stipulated that the school district would demolish Columbia at its own cost within 12 months of occupancy of the new school, although nothing would prohibit the district from selling that property. It also required the school district to demolish West Central at its own cost within 36 months of occupancy of the new school unless it had another use for the old building or can sell or transfer the property to another user, according to previous Globe reports. It’s possible that a private investor could be interested in restoring Columbia, similar to the way that the Downtown Joplin Alliance is marketing the old Union Depot to potential buyers. But in all honesty, Columbia probably should just be torn down because of its cracking, settling and other structural problems. We’d love to see that lot donated back to the city of Joplin, which gave up its Dover Hill property at no cost for construction of the new school, for use as a public park. West Central has a little more potential. It is structurally sound and sits along busy Seventh Street, the current Route 66. A creative and motivated buyer could turn that school into a Route 66 attraction or city museum. Another possibility is the school district using it for some of its programs in the way that it used the old Duquesne Elementary School, at least for a while, to store materials for its prom-focused Operation Fairy Godmother program. Or perhaps West Central could be turned into housing for families in need? Watered Gardens has done something similar with the old Washington Education Center on Second Street, transforming that building into temporary living quarters for mothers and their children. No one wants to see those schools sit vacant for too long and deteriorate into crumbling, unusable eyesores. We encourage the school district to explore all options in the coming year to find a solution for the buildings. \n",

      "A 28-year-old defendant pleaded guilty this week to felony assault and firearm charges and was sent to prison for six years. Rico M. Love Howard, of Joplin, pleaded guilty Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court to third-degree assault and unlawful possession of a firearm in a plea deal limiting the prison time he might receive to no more than six years. Judge Gayle Crane accepted the plea agreement and assessed Howard concurrent terms of six years on the firearm conviction and four years for the assault. The judge further ordered that the sentences run concurrently with any time he is assessed for violating his probation on a vehicle tampering conviction. The convictions pertain to an assault Oct. 26 at the Economy Inn & Suites on West 30th Street in Joplin. A probable-cause affidavit filed in the case states that Howard struck a woman in the face, causing her nose to bleed. He purportedly had a pistol with him at the time but denied having struck her with it. As a convicted felon, he is not allowed to possess firearms. \n",

      "The Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity celebrated the completion of its first multifamily housing unit, a duplex at 1405-1407 E. Sixth St. in Joplin, and handed over the keys to the new homeowners during a dedication Wednesday. Ground was broken on the duplex in the spring. The storm-resistant duplex was built using construction techniques developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety to provide less costly resilient housing. The institute’s program is part of the Habitat Strong program, which is designed to promote the building of homes that are more durable, resilient and physically strong, according to Scott Clayton, executive director of the local Habitat chapter. Clayton said this is the first time that they’ve built a duplex and that the project went well. “We would like to repeat this and expand it to where we can do a triplex or offer some three-bedroom units,” he said. “We’re excited that we started a new endeavor. ”Each unit has two bedrooms, two full bathrooms and a garage. Each has a kitchen, a living room, walk-in closets and a laundry room. A storm shelter is also built into the backyard. The new homeowners are Teresa Davis and Gina Ehrmantrout, who met when they were working on their units. The two were quick to become friends. “This has been the best Christmas present ever,” Davis said. “I live in a tiny apartment that’s upstairs, and my dad hasn’t been able to come visit me there. I can now have him over. I also really love to cook, and I have a big kitchen now. ”Ehrmantrout said she wants to continue to volunteer with Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity after the move. “I learned how to hang siding, and I watched them do the framing,” she said. “I’ve learned a lot. ”Fred Osborn, vice president of the Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity board, said that they’ve built several single-family homes without garages, but they were able to step it up this year with the duplex. “This is always my favorite thing to do for Habitat because today we turn a house into a home,” he said. Barbie Huff, director of family service with the organization, said the family selection committee looks at three basic criteria when a person applies for a home: a need for better housing, ability to pay and willingness to partner with Habitat. “They have to meet certain income guidelines, and they need to have a certain debt-to-income ratio,” she said. “There also has to be a need for housing, whether it’s too expensive or in terrible shape. These two women came along during the time when we were envisioning this duplex. We thought this would be perfect for them. ”The homeowners are required to complete 200-300 hours of labor on their home and those of other families. Habitat homes are sold to the new homeowners at no profit and no interest. “We do no-interest loans, and the mortgage payments come back to us,” Osborn said. “We turn around and leverage those to build other homes. If you’ve ever dropped anything off at ReStore, we pay a little bit of overhead for the store, but everything else goes to the bottom line. ”Clayton said four other Habitat homes are under construction and are nearing completion. With the duplex, Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity has built 181 homes throughout the region since its start as an affiliate in 1989. \n",

      "Dwight and Diane Brennfoerder were chosen the 2022 winners of The Joplin Globe’s fourth annual Home Holiday Lighting and Decorating Contest. Their house is at 1902 N. Park Ave. in the Royal Heights neighborhood. Dwight Brennfoerder, 78, said they have lived there since 1987 and have decorated every year. “Until this year, I did it all myself. This year I hired (for) the high parts. The high eaves are 18 feet in the air,” he said. The house has strings of lights around the roof, the porch, and also on the fences out front, as well as on a playhouse he built for his children. There is also a large lighted wreath. He estimated they used about 2,000 bulbs in all. “It’s a traditional four-square house that has been here for since 1900, and so we kind of like to show it off,” Dwight Brennfoerder said. He added that his family is coming home and that the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren like to see it decorated. The Globe has sponsored a contest since 2019, and this year’s winner will receive a $100 gift card from this year’s sponsor, Wayside Furniture in Joplin. Photos of all nominated residences were posted on the Globe’s website, www. joplinglobe. com. Public voting, which began Dec. 12 and ran through Dec. 16, determined the winner. Some previous winners also confirmed they have continued and even expanded decorating again this year. • 2020 winner: John and Deborah Hird, and their home at 11 Quail Ridge Drive, won the Globe’s second Home Holiday Lighting and Decorating Contest.

      "PINEVILLE, Mo. — Changes are in the works for the McDonald County Chamber of Commerce, and a vision for the future is incubating, chamber President and CEO John Newby said this week. A recent agreement with McDonald County officials to become a co-tenant in the building located at 306 Harmon St. on the Pineville square will expand the chamber’s services for residents, business owners and students, Newby announced Wednesday. The MU Extension office currently is housed in that location. “The discussion started two or three years ago, and it was kept alive by Scott Dennis, a member of our chamber board,” Newby said. “It really took off these past few months when we became aware of a potential grant that might be a great fit for what we wanted to do. ”With the additional 1,500 square feet of space, the chamber will be able to offer new services that the board has felt for some time are needed in the county. “The current space will become the student chamber coffee shop with a connected conference room,” Newby said. “The new space will become the official chamber office, taking in about one-third of the space, and the remaining area will be dedicated to the Entrepreneurial & Innovation Incubator Center. ”The focus of the center is to help startup businesses and current business owners with starting or maintaining a business. “It will be a complete startup and ongoing business training center coupled with a marketing agency ready to assist McDonald County businesses in most aspects of their business,” Newby said. The original structure will be taken completely down to the studs, all the electrical systems replaced and new technology added. The relocation of MU Extension offices to the current health department building is one part of a list of projects for the county. “This is going to be a good move for McDonald County Extension services,” said Jennifer Lutes, field specialist in agricultural business for MU Extension in McDonald County. “With the much larger space of the current health department building, we plan to expand our services, with hopes of adding a learning center and kitchen, as well as potential new staff. ”MU Extension works with counties in the state to bring educational and youth programs to residents. Programs don’t just deal with agriculture, but also with healthy lifestyle choices and financial training. The responsibility of the host county is to provide office space and salary for administrative staff. History of projectIn 2020, McDonald County began to consider updating the current health department with a new structure. With American Rescue Plan Act funding totaling nearly $800,000, the county began seeking bids for the new building to be located at the junction of Old Highway 71 and Interstate 49, a location that makes the county’s health services easily accessible. “Our health department may be the only health provider for some of our lower-income families,” Presiding Commissioner Bill Lant said. County Clerk Kimberly Bell said the county received two bids for the construction, with the job going to Harner Construction, of Noel. With the building in the final stages of construction, there are currently two bid projects still open to complete the new health department and WIC offices, sewer and water. Those bid opportunities can be found on the McDonald County government website under “bids. ”ARPA funds will need to be spent by 2024 under the grant criteria. Funding for the county, its operations and projects come solely from sales taxes. “Residents are often confused about where their real estate and property tax dollars are spent,” Bell said. “Those funds do not come to the county, but 100% of it supports local schools, fire districts and public libraries. ”According to Newby, being in business is tough. He started in May as chamber president and CEO, and previously worked as a consultant to communities in revitalizing their downtowns. He writes a column called “Building Main Street, Not Wall Street” that appears weekly in The Joplin Globe. “As a chamber, we need to be in a position to offer lifelines to businesses and startups,” Newby said. “Just as a declining business base indicates a declining community, likewise a vibrant business community indicates a vibrant community. ”\n",

      "It appears that Joplin will be getting a new sub shop in 2023. Jersey Mike’s Subs, according to its website, is planning to open its shop in a storefront at 1702 S. Range Line Road. This is next door to the AT&T store. The nearest Jersey Mike’s locations are in Bentonville, Arkansas, and Springfield. According to the website, the opening will be in 2023. Details will be posted on the website, including employment opportunities, as they become available. This development was spotted by a reader who brought it to my attention. Jersey Mike’s Subs, operated by A Sub Above, is a submarine sandwich chain based in Manasquan, New Jersey. The franchise has about 2,000 U. S. locations. That compares with about 21,000 locations for Subway. Each Jersey Mike’s Subs serves sandwiches made to order, slicing the meats and cheeses as needed. Sandwiches can be topped off “Mike’s Way,” with onions, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, spices and “The Juice,” a mixture of red wine vinegar and olive oil. Some Jersey Mike’s locations also serve sandwiches for breakfast. For some, another sandwich shop in Joplin is no big deal. My experience with these sandwich shops over the years has become quite favorable. I have a favorite at Subway, at Jimmy John’s and at Firehouse Subs, and I would have a favorite at the homegrown Sub Shop Deli in Webb City if I lived there.

      "It can be hard to let go of the familiar, especially when it’s attached to such an important part of your life. Childhood homes come to mind. But so do workplace buildings. If we have any longevity on a job, the building where we work day after day, year after year becomes like an old friend. We know every inch of it. We know its idiosyncrasies. And, if its walls could talk, they could tell many a story about us, both professional and personal. For me, the building now being retired by Spiva Center for the Arts is such a place. For six years, my home away from home was the Cosgrove Building, home of Spiva. Not only did I work there, but I attended events there, making the place part of my social life. It’s where I gained much of my knowledge of art, area artists and the diverse matters of the local art community. It’s the first gallery where I exhibited my artwork and the first gift shop where I sold it. It wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that the old Spiva building contributed to who I am today, certainly in relation to my passion for the arts. I’m sure Spiva staff and plenty of area artists and community members feel similarly. But we must let go of the Grand Old Lady as Spiva moves on to the next chapter of its journey, now in the Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex, recently opened at Seventh and Joplin streets. Now, the historic Cosgrove Building that housed Spiva for 28 years is up for sale. The starting price is $1. 25 million, according to Heather Lesmeister, Spiva executive director. For now, the sale is being handled by the Spiva board, but a real estate agent will be secured soon, she said. Spiva staff is still packing its historic records and other documents and arranging for a sale of remaining furnishings in hopes of having the building sold by early next year. Located at 222 W. Third St. , the two-story, red brick Cosgrove Building is recognizable by its storefront-style display windows that allow people to peer into its gift shop or capture a glimpse of some of the artwork exhibited in its two first floor galleries. There’s also the familiar op art mural on its west exterior wall and the sculptural art that hangs on its south exterior wall. The building was constructed for $20,000 in 1913. Henrietta Cosgrove had it built as an office building, housing business operations of her and her husband’s mining business, as well as those of Atlas Powder Co. Through the decades, it also housed offices of Eagle-Picher Mining Co. and other mining companies. Cosgrove was a philanthropist and political activist who was involved in the women’s suffrage movement. She was most widely known for successfully fighting for widows’ pensions for mining workers. She was also a writer, authoring “Amateur Art,” an instruction book for beginning artists, particularly painters, according to her profile in the 1914-1915 edition of the Woman’s Who’s Who of America. What synchronicity that her building eventually would become a community art center. After an upgrade of the Cosgrove, Spiva moved into it in 1994. It was the third location for the art center. The first quarters of the organization, originally founded as the Ozarks Artists Guild in 1948, was in the old Zelleken mansion at Fourth and Sergeant streets. It was secured through the support of local philanthropist George A. Spiva. By 1967, the organization had outgrown that location and it moved to the campus of what is now Missouri Southern State University. Seeking a more central location, it moved to the Cosgrove building in the downtown district. At that location, Spiva began growing its prominence in the community. Its number of exhibits grew and it brought in selected works of such noted artists as Pablo Picasso and Norman Rockwell. Under the Cosgrove roof, it built its reputation for its annual national photography competitive, PhotoSpiva, preparing to enter its 46th year, and it expanded its class offerings and outreach to schools and underserved populations. Once everything needed in the Cornell Complex has been removed from the Cosgrove, a sale is planned for the remaining contents. Because new office furniture and other business furnishings were provided by the Cornell Complex, old furnishings will be available in the sale. The intricately carved antique chairs and library table that have taken center stage in the building’s board room and art library will be up for sale, as will be display cases and shelving from the gift shop. There will also be office furniture and general office equipment available. Basically, everything is going, aside from most of the books in its art library, said Lesmeister. With the sale, we will say goodbye to our old friend as an art center. People have commented that they will miss the personality of the historic building and the warmth of its smaller space, compared with the Spiva space at the Cornell Complex. But it’s all about growth and better meeting the arts needs of the community. “It’s been such a wonderful building and served Spiva well over the years,” said Lesmeister. “I hope someone will love it as much as we have. ”\n",

      "Residents of Southwest Missouri are being asked by the Missouri Department of Economic Development to provide information about the accuracy of a map that shows access to high-speed internet or gaps in service. Corrections or additions to a new broadband map published by the Federal Communications Commission are being sought in hopes that they could help the state of Missouri receive more federal funding for broadband expansion, according to the governor's office. \"As we make historic investments to expand internet access, I encourage Missourians to participate in the FCC’s broadband map challenge process,\" Gov. Mike Parson said in a statement. \"Ensuring we have an accurate understanding of broadband coverage in Missouri is vital. Maps that reflect our needs will ensure our state receives and administers the necessary resources to advance our progress in this critical priority. \"The broadband map challenge is intended to identify errors in the new FCC map that would prevent Missouri from receiving its full share of funding through the upcoming Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program.  Errors on the map could involve physical locations of broadband access or types of internet service availability. To ensure that existing service for homes, businesses, and communities is accurately represented, any resident can examine the map and provide input. The FCC map displays the available data across the state and denotes where there is service or if areas are unserved or underserved. Challenges to the map will be accepted until Jan. 13. \"We hope every Missourian will take part in this historic moment for broadband expansion,\" said B. J.

      "A youth group at a Joplin church and a longtime area ministry continue to share the love of Christ this Christmas through an outreach that is nothing less than amazing. The Girls in Action at Harmony Heights Baptist and the American Rehabilitation Ministries Prison Outreach have set a Christmas standard that is hard to imagine, let alone equal. The Harmony Heights Girls in Action, consisting of girls in first through sixth grade, came to my attention seven months after a deadly tornado smashed into Joplin in 2011. Around Christmas that year, the girls were involved in doing what they have done so many times before — helping children around the world through the Billy Graham Samaritan’s Purse ministry. At a time when their minds and hearts could have easily been with only their congregation, whose church was destroyed by the deadly twister, these youngsters found time to do for others not so close to home. The idea of the outreach, Operation Christmas Child, is to pack and mail shoeboxes stuffed with school supplies, toys and other items of necessity for children in poverty around the world. In talking with Charlie Burnett, pastor of Harmony Heights, this week, I found that the kids have never let up in their overseas ministry. Early this month, they put 100 boxes in the mail to help make Christmas a bit brighter for children who find life not so bright, especially at Christmas. American Rehabilitation MinistriesIn recently checking with the American Rehabilitation Ministries headquarters at 3605 N. Main St. , I found that nothing has changed with the ministry’s Christmas approach to showing the importance of this holy holiday. ARM will soon celebrate its 50th anniversary, and little has driven this outreach more than the mailing of Christmas cards, which are going to prisoners in 459 prisons around the United States. One of the leaders of ARM, Troy Nelson, said the ministry has purchased 756,000 Christmas cards this year and so far have mailed out 672,625. Nelson added that in 2022 alone, ARM has provided a total of 1,670,000 cards to prisoners covering not only Christmas, but also Easter and Mother’s Day. Joe Garman, retired president of ARM, said the biggest demand for cards is at Christmas. He noted that although nothing is put into the cards, they do contain a Bible verse. Those cards will undoubtedly do some good somewhere, and the same can be said for the Girls in Action youth ministry at Harmony Heights. \n",

      "“Amahl and Night Visitors,” an enduring Christmas story that is performed each year by various opera companies across America, will be presented on three area stages this holiday season by Heartland Opera Theatre. The popular opera will be presented at 7 p. m. Friday, Dec. 16, at the Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex, Seventh and Joplin streets; 7 p. m. Saturday, Dec. 17, at Northwood Arts and Event Center, 115 N. Wood St. , Neosho; and 2 p. m. Sunday, Dec. 18, at Carthage Memorial Hall, 407 S. Garrison Ave. The performances are free. “Amahl” was the first opera specifically composed for television in the United States. The NBC television network commissioned Italian composer Gian Carlo Menotti to write the opera. It was first performed by the NBC Opera Theater on Dec. 24, 1951, in New York City’s Rockefeller Center, where it was broadcast live on television. This is the second time that it’s being presented in Joplin, Carthage and Neosho. It was first performed in 2018, and it was so well received that it’s being brought back this year, said director Madison King. “The story, its themes and message resonate with everyone during the Christmas season,” she said. “This opera is in English, the music is easy to listen to, as well as beautiful. ”Based on Italian folk tales of the Nativity, the opera is a retelling of the story of the Magi from the view of a young disabled boy named Amahl, who lives in poverty with his widowed mother. After a long journey following the star of Bethlehem, the three Magi — King Balthazar, King Kaspar and King Melchior — stop at Amahl and his mother’s home, seeking a place to rest. They are carrying gifts, including gold, to deliver to the Christ child, and Amahl’s mother becomes blinded by the allure of the gold and what it could do for her family. She is caught attempting to steal a bit of the treasure, but King Melchior tells her she may keep the gold because the Holy child will not need earthly wealth to build his kingdom. She declines the gold, but she still wants to send a gift, although she has nothing to offer. Amahl, too, has nothing to give to the Christ child except his crutch. When he offers it to the kings, his crippled leg is miraculously healed. Amahl then journeys with the three kings to see the Christ child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed. In addition to the Christmas themes of the opera, it is also its shortness — it’s only one act — that makes it appealing, said William Mountz, Heartland Opera president. That makes it more family friendly, he said. He also attributes its appeal to the music and to the talent of the lead performers, all hailing from Joplin, Carthage, and Pittsburg, Kansas, he said. Heidi Smorstad and Anne Marie Wright are returning as the mother and Amahl, respectively, the same roles they performed in 2018. “Heidi Smorstad is a real talent,” Mountz said. “We are also so lucky to have Madison King directing. She is a talented singer as well, but our performers always enjoy working with her and she always delivers on the quality of her productions. ”In addition to Smorstad and Wright, the cast includes Brian Hargrave as King Balthazar; Patrick Howle as King Melchior; JJ Ramos as King Kaspar; and Jeremy Reves as the page. A Shepherds Chorus includes 20 local singers, and the pianist for the performances is Kathy Nenadal, who has played in previous Heartland shows. While Hargrave, Howle and Ramos have performed in several Heartland concerts and productions, this is Reves’ opera debut, said King. For a few years, the opera theater has been considering a regular performance of “Amahl,” alternating it with the Christmas caroling it has been offering at area homes the last couple of years, Mountz said. “COVID knocked us off track a bit, but we are finally starting to rebound from that and are trying to get back on track,” he said. “We unfortunately don’t have the resources to do both caroling and ‘Amahl. ’”While the Cornell Complex is one of the sites of this performance, the opera group intends to continue its offerings in a variety of venues, including nontraditional ones as a form of outreach, Mountz said. Such past nontraditional venues have included coffee shops and Spiva Center for the Arts. It has also offered elementary school enrichment programs, including virtual performances via the Zoom platform. \n",

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — A 22-year-old Joplin man waived a preliminary hearing Monday on charges that he choked a woman during a disturbance at a residence on Ruby Way. Dylan J. Armstrong waived the hearing in Newton County Circuit Court and was ordered to stand trial on felony counts of second-degree assault, first-degree property damage and resisting arrest. Judge Christine Rhoades set the defendant's initial appearance in a trial division of the court for Feb. 8. The charges pertain to an altercation July 23 at 3420 S. Ruby Way between Armstrong and Marquis Saunders during which Armstrong choked Saunders' mother as well as Saunders and pulled out some of Saunders' hair, according to a probable-cause affidavit. Saunders fled the residence to a liquor store on Hearnes Boulevard, where the defendant purportedly followed him and began destroying displays and throwing bottles. The store owner told police that Armstrong also kicked out the glass in the front door of the store. Damage to the door and merchandise was estimated at $5,000, according to the affidavit. \n",

      "A 31-year-old rural Joplin man has pleaded to a felony domestic assault of his girlfriend in a plea deal dismissing a charge that he subsequently tried to get her to drop the original charge. Matthew E. Spurgeon changed his plea to guilty Tuesday in Jasper County Circuit Court on a charge of second-degree domestic assault in a plea agreement allowing a suspended sentence. Judge David Mouton accepted the plea and granted Spurgeon a five-year suspended sentence with five years of supervised probation. Spurgeon assaulted Amanda White during a domestic disturbance the night of July 17, 2019, and extending into the following day before a deputy arrived at their residence on Faison Lane in response to a request for a well-being check. The deputy noticed upon arrival that White had bruising near an eye, and she told him that Spurgeon had slapped her cheekbone beneath the eye the previous night, according to a probable-cause affidavit. She said he had taken her cellphone away from her the following day and locked her in a bedroom with him to keep her from leaving. The defendant was accused of later persuading White to drop the charge prior to a preliminary hearing three years ago. But the prosecutor’s office subpoenaed her for the hearing and filed a motion seeking to be allowed to present statements she had made to police as evidence at the hearing if she failed to show up. The motion — which sought to circumvent a defendant’s right to face their accuser in court through a legal doctrine known as forfeiture of wrongdoing — became moot when White showed up to testify. But the state’s case was arguably weakened when Spurgeon’s attorney asked her if he had struck her in the course of trying to avoid a glass she threw at him and if the blow actually may have been accidental, and she had replied that she did not know. \n",

      "A convenience store in Joplin was broken into for a fourth and fifth time in three weeks early Wednesday morning. Police say another business nearby also was broken into during the night but that they were able to arrest a suspect in one of the three Wednesday burglaries. Capt. Williams Davis said three burglars who broke into the Zips In and Out store at 1201 S. Range Line Road about 2 a. m. stuffed a backpack full of merchandise and got away before officers arrived in response to an alarm. About half an hour later, the store was entered for a second time, and about $80 worth of cigarettes were taken. The two burglaries were the fourth and fifth time the store was hit by burglars in the past three weeks. Davis said that police received a call about 3 a. m. from an employee of a store open for business at the time in the 1500 block of South Range Line Road concerning a man in the store bragging about having broken into another business. Officers responding to the call contacted Corbin M. Gunter, 26, of Nevada, Missouri, at the open business and eventually arrested him. He was charged with having committed the second burglary of the night at the Zips In and Out store. A business alarm at Vapor Maven, 1006 S. Range Line Road, was triggered at 4:24 a. m. when someone broke a window there to commit a third burglary in the area within two and a half hours. Davis said merchandise appeared to have been disturbed inside Vapor Maven and that there was evidence that someone tried to get into a cash register. But it was not yet known Thursday what, if anything, had been stolen. The Zips store was broken into Monday of this week and Nov. 21 and Nov. 24. Juveniles are suspected in those burglaries as well as the first one Wednesday morning. \n",

      "An office on the first floor of Joplin City Hall will be remodeled to provide working space for an expanded team to address declining neighborhoods. The City Council last week advanced on first reading a construction services contract with Industrial Electric allowing a $78,557 payment for the work. Dan Johnson, public works director, said the remodeling work would be done to convert an office on the first floor for the use needed to address neighborhood improvements. Stabilizing and cleaning up deteriorating neighborhoods is a goal set by the council as part of a 2020 strategic plan. It is one of the items to be funded by the use tax approved by voters in November 2021. Johnson said the office renovation was put in this year's budget. City staff in the planning and building department drew up the plans for the renovations and wrote the bid documents. The city received two bids for the work. American Construction Inc. submitted a higher bid of $79,781. When first proposed, the first-floor remodeling was to include the main staircase in the lobby and the mezzanine. The mezzanine currently houses the working documents and drawings of artist Thomas Hart Benton, who painted \"Joplin at the Turn of the Century,\" a mural commissioned for Joplin's centennial celebration in 1973. The mural is displayed above the main-floor elevators. However, there was public opposition expressed to the council and city officials to altering the mezzanine of the historic building, which originally served as Newman's department store, an early purveyor of family clothing and accessories as well as household goods. Mayor Doug Lawson had previously said the staircase, mezzanine and Benton collection were favorite spots of visitors and bus tours that stop at City Hall, and that former mayors would oppose changes to that part of the building. City Manager Nick Edwards said at the time that he would remove that part of the plan, which would have involved encasing the mezzanine in glass and placing a police security officer there, making it off-limits to the public. The mayor last week asked if the stairs and the mezzanine would remain as they are currently if the construction agreement were approved. The public works director said they would. The council approved the contract. The council also:• Authorized the purchase of mobile and portable police radios at a cost of $394,795. 83 from Motorola Solutions Inc. Brian Lewis, the assistant police chief, said the radios would replace equipment that is about 15 years old. • Approved a demolition bid of $2,759 with B&D Yardbuilders for 2012 S. Connor Ave. The council was told it appeared that someone made a failed attempt to repair the property. After work stopped, the city received complaints about the condition of the property and standing water that collected there and produced mosquitoes. The city's Building Board of Appeals ordered demolition after the owner walked away from the project and would not respond to city contacts. The bid for the demolition was the lowest of six bids. • Approved the sale of three lots to Habitat for Humanity that had been turned over to the city and had been declared excess property to be sold. Those are 1513 E. Hill St. for $3,927; 909 Langston Hughes-Broadway for $9,727; and 304 N. Cox for $6,007. \n",

      "An interior remodel at Target and an expansion at Owens Corning launched building permits for the 2023 fiscal year in Joplin. According to building permits filed in November, Target is investing $4. 3 million in commercial improvement for its store at 3151 E. Seventh St. Officials with the store and with the retailer's corporate offices did not respond to requests for additional information. Owens Corning filed a nearly $2. 6 million building permit in November for a plant expansion at 1983 State Line Road. In a statement, spokesperson Todd Romain said the permit is \"to expand our packaging capabilities at our Joplin, Missouri, mineral wool manufacturing facility, which will increase the flexibility of our plant to meet customer demand. This project is expected to kick off this coming summer (2023) and to be completed in early 2024, with no impact to customer deliveries during this time. \"In all, $10. 4 million in building permits was filed in November. The city's fiscal year runs from Nov. 1 to Oct. 31, and the permits reflect only that construction taking place within the city limits of Joplin. Also in November, four permits were filed for new homes, with a combined value of $960,000, according to city permit information, or an average of nearly $240,000 per home. For the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31, construction in the city hit $224,548,386, according to city building permit records. That compares with $168. 2 million in construction the previous year of Nov. 1, 2020, to Oct. 31, 2021. Total building in Joplin the year prior, which ended Oct. 31, 2020, came to nearly $246 million, also rivaling the construction that took place in 2012 and 2013, when building was taking place after the 2011 tornado. From 2011 through 2013, construction in Joplin topped $200 million each year, as new schools, new homes, new stores, a new hospital and other buildings were erected.

      "Cold weather cut the Salvation Army of Jasper and Newton Counties' annual red kettle fundraising campaign short three days before it was supposed to end on Christmas Eve, leaving the campaign far short of meeting its goal of $450,000 in 2022. Nathan Hicks, volunteer coordinator with the Salvation Army, said Friday that this year's campaign had raised 52% of its goal, leaving it $215,000 short. He said bitterly cold temperatures forced the organization to cancel bell ringing at area kettles Thursday and Friday of last week. Lt. Jennifer Norris said volunteers were able to get a few kettles out Saturday, which was Christmas Eve and the final day of the fundraising campaign. Between those kettles and a few \"generous\" donations, the Salvation Army raised another $12,000 toward its goal, leaving just over $200,000 still needed, she said. Norris said losing those two days before Christmas Eve had an impact on the campaign. “Those last few days before Christmas usually bring in a significant amount,” she said. “If we had more bell ringers on Christmas Eve and bell ringing on the two days prior, we could have raised about $15,000 to $20,000. Our mailed-in donations are a lot lower this year as well. ”At the red kettle campaign kickoff in November, Lt. Marty Norris, who serves as corps officer in Joplin with Jennifer Norris, said the 2022 goal was a little bigger than the goal in 2021. The Salvation Army raised 105% of its goal in 2021. He said the red kettle campaign typically provides about 75% of the local Salvation Army’s funding for the year. \"We do it because the need is so great, and we see it a lot more this time of year when the temperature starts dropping, it get colder,\" he said. \"We work to provide for the necessary needs of the individuals who are stuck out in it. ”Where it goesAccording to Jennifer Norris, the following is a list of the services provided by the Salvation Army of Jasper and Newton Counties each year and funded in large part by the red kettle campaign:• The organization has church services in Joplin on Sundays. • It will start a Bible study group in Carthage. • It has served more than 58,000 cases with social services in the past year. • It has provided housing or rental assistance to more than 1,400 families in the past year. • It has assisted 1,300 families with utility bills. • It has provided clothing vouchers to 3,000 families in the past year. • It helps with personal grooming needs, such as a shower and laundry, at the Joplin location, and personal grooming items are available at Joplin and Carthage. • It offers clothing vouchers. • It provides housing and utility assistance when money is available. • It offers a free daily feeding program with breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday and lunch on Saturday at the Joplin location and sack lunches in Carthage on Monday through Thursday. • It serves 4,000 hot meals a month at the Joplin location. • It serves a hot lunch to anyone who wants one on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, with more than 225 meals served on each holiday. • It serves around 200 meals a week from a mobile canteen in Joplin. • It has a senior food box distribution program and operates food pantries in Carthage and Joplin. The Salvation Army’s Joplin office is located at 320 E. Eighth St. The Family Store is located at 302 E. Seventh St. The Salvation Army Social Service Center is located at 2307 Missouri Ave. in Carthage. \n",

      "Three collection sites will be available in Joplin starting Monday to discard natural Christmas trees. Trees, stripped of decorations, can be placed by \"Christmas Tree Drop-Off\" signs located at:• Humphrey Park on Utica Street in the Royal Heights area. • McIndoe Park at Glendale Road and Jackson Avenue in the southwest corner of the parking lot. • Public Works Center at 1301 W. Second St. Residents may pick up discarded trees at those locations to use for fish habitats. City staff will take the remaining trees to the city’s processing site to be chipped. Many other types of holiday items can be taken to the Joplin Recycling Center, including gift wrap, paper boxes, bottles, cans, greeting cards and cooking oil. The center is located at 1310 W. \"A\" St. It is open noon to 6 p. m. Tuesday and Thursday and 9 a. m. to 3 p. m. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The Recycling Center will be closed on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. If your community does not offer a tree-recycling program, there are several creative ways to make further use of your tree, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation:• You can place the tree in the backyard to offer cover for wildlife, or under bird feeders to provide nesting locations in the branches. • Your tree can be shredded or chipped for mulch. • You can sink your tree in a pond to enhance fish habitat. According to John Schulte, MDC fisheries management biologist, the trees provide woody cover that makes excellent habitat for invertebrates. These are an ideal food source for smaller fish, in turn bringing in bigger fish and creating a situation that gives a boost to the lake’s entire food chain, he said. MDC officials will collect natural Christmas trees and recycle them for fish and wildlife habitat projects through Jan. 31 in Nevada. Trees can be dropped off at a designated site at the Walmart store parking lot, 2250 E. Lincoln Ave. , on the city’s east side near the 3M plant. • If you used a live evergreen and your ground is still soft enough to spade up, add it to your home landscape for years of enjoyment and wildlife cover. \n",

      "Work continues on the city’s effort to commit $13. 8 million in grant money from the American Rescue Plan Act toward up to $57 million in proposed construction and initiatives for community projects. Since applications started in September, the city has committed about $5 million of the $13. 8 million to projects that will receive additional funding from other grant sources, the City Council was told at a meeting Monday night. Leslie Haase, the city’s finance director, said city administrators did not immediately commit to spend any of $13. 8 million early this year when they learned of the allocation. “We held on to that money for a reason, and that was to match these other grants we knew were coming down the pike. These are unprecedented times. The grant opportunities at the state and federal levels have not been seen in my career. ”Though the city has been criticized by some residents for spending money on master plans and studies to assess needs and resources in many city departments and for many projects, those studies have laid the groundwork for the funding opportunities. “Without the master plan and the studies we’ve been working on, these grants would not happen,” Haase said. The grants require public input, and those studies and master plans gathered that input. “If we had not gotten the public input, our applications would not be as strong as they are,” Haase said, adding that the listening tour that City Manager Nick Edwards conducted also is a vital component of that public input to show in the grant applications that residents recognize the need for the projects and initiatives. “The hope again is to bring in federal and state dollars that will bring about visionary projects,” Haase said. ARPA funds will only be committed if the city is awarded the grants that are applied for with the help of a consultant. “If we don’t get the grants, we will go back to the drawing board,” Haase said. Dami Kehinde, with Guidehouse, the city’s consultant on the grants project, said that 10 out of the top 20 projects ranked by the council as priorities are being funded or partially funded through state grants and/or ARPA. Fifteen of the projects are eligible for other state and federal grant programs. There have been four grants awarded for stormwater and wastewater projects that address nine local initiatives and public works projects. There also are grants for police and fire equipment, housing, education and parks. State ARPA grant opportunities that align with Joplin initiatives have been largely released and are currently in the application cycle, Kehinde said. Additionally, agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U. S. Department of Transportation are releasing new opportunities, she said. There also are grants available for projects ranked lower on the city’s priority list, those below the top 20. They include an ARPA grant for local tourism development, which might cover the city’s plan to build the Dover Outdoor Recreation Area, a biking and trail connectivity project on the west side of Dover Hill Park. There is an industrial site development grant that might provide money toward expansion of Crossroads Center Distribution and Business Park. The city has been awarded $22 million toward stormwater projects to reduce flooding. The work would be done at various locations from 17th Street and Annie Baxter Avenue to the East Town neighborhood and others. Mayor Pro Tem Keenan Cortez asked what other grant opportunities are becoming available. He was told those are federal grants made possible by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. Still on the table and previously discussed by council members is a request to commit $1. 5 million to construction of a MSSU Health Science Innovation Center on the university campus. City staff will bring forward a pledge agreement on that for council review at a meeting Dec. 19. \n",

      "It’s not so much that I miss holiday shopping at the mall. What I miss is the hustle and bustle. Who would’ve thought that circling the parking lots for half an hour to find just one available spot, fighting your way through crowds and perfume samples in multiple department stores, waiting in line for hours to see Santa, and shamelessly noshing on junk food in the food court while people-watching was something we’d one day speak of in the past tense?The holiday crowds pale in comparison to years past, but Northpark Mall is still there and continues, I hope, to see a peak in sales this season. As someone who writes about downtown businesses, I feel comfortable wishing the mall well because it’s no longer Main Street’s rival. That rivalry was replaced by the internet long ago. Yes, the convenience of doing all of your holiday shopping under one roof has been replaced with doing all of your holiday shopping under your roof. But what we’ve learned throughout the pandemic is that no app or home delivery service can replace the experience of going out. We’re social creatures, even the most introverted. Isn’t December the perfect time to see and be seen — even while out running errands?I say put your glad rags on and spend these next few weekends shopping downtown. In one of my many attempts to be more like Oprah, I’ve created a list of favorite things that should act more as inspiration than an all-out guide. Please forgive me if I forget a business or good. What I really want you to do is shop local, which is why I’ve broadened my horizons to locations around downtown’s perimeter. Here are a few ideas for everyone on your list:• For the artist: Give the gift of inspiration by offering Connect2Culture season tickets or a membership to George A. Spiva Center for the Arts. Now that both are housed at the Cornell Complex, these passes will give them access to downtown Joplin’s most exciting new address. For art you can take home, consider purchasing from Spiva’s gift shop; Local Color Art Gallery and Studio; or Urban Art Gallery, where you can also buy pottery and jewelry and sign up for monthly classes. Don’t forget that some of the best places to purchase art downtown are local restaurants and coffee shops, as well. • For the foodie: Create the ultimate gift basket with flavors that represent your hometown (and that you’ll be tempted to keep yourself). Start by picking up cheese and charcuterie from the Boardroom, and crowlers of locally brewed beer from Chaos Brewery. Add in pint glasses, house beer syrup, and sweatshirts from the Bruncheonette. Pick up dry rubs and sauces from Hackett Hot Wings, cookies from Coley’s Cookie Company and Frosted Cakerie, baked goods from Farmhouse Bakery, and a bread subscription to Forest + Field. Finish it off with tokens from Joplin Empire Market, Eagle’s Landing Wine (sold by Just A Taste at the market most weekends), and gift certificates to downtown restaurants such as Crabby’s, Club 609, Red Onion Cafe, B&B Bistro, M&M Bistro, Wilder’s, Carmine’s, and more. Celebrate your success with a very festive punch bowl at The Living Room to end the day!• For the coffee addict: Life’s too short to start each morning fighting your way through a drive-thru line, Joplin! Pick up your very own bag of beans (or a cup of joe to go) from Cottage Small at Joplin Empire Market, Joplin Avenue Coffee Company, Bearded Lady Coffee Roasters, Beaten Path Coffee Shop, or Zinc in Midtown. Most also sell mugs and other coffee-making tools to inspire your inner barista. • For the hobby horse: For the person on your list who either collects hobbies or is in desperate need of one. Why not a monthly membership to Bookhouse Cinema for the budding cinephile, houseplants in need of love from Plant Parenthood, comic books from Hurley’s Heroes, sewing materials from Fabric Merchant, a pile of good things to read from Changing Hands Book Shoppe, or registration to the ax-throwing league at Main Street Axe Company? The latter is also great for burning off post-holiday stress. •For the fashion-forward: Whether shopping for sneakers or a wedding dress, there’s a downtown boutique for that. Shop til you drop at Lennons, Sophie, Blush, Blue Moon Boutique, Mint Cove, Bartlett’s Shoe Company, and King’s Emporium. For the fanciest of holiday parties (or weddings), check out Royalty At Best, Lovie’s Recycled Weddings, or the newly-opened Augusta Bridal, and finish off your look with a little visit to Newton’s Jewelers. • For the stressed-out: A little holiday relaxation might look like a day spent at Cutting Edge, Salon 529, or Viola Salon. Or perhaps it’s an afternoon of virtual reality at Pennington Station. You do you. • For the pragmatic: We all know someone who puts a vacuum cleaner on their Christmas list. For those in search of home appliances, tools and all things practical, look no further than Pearl Brothers. Browse the rotating merchandise they feature on their first floor and I guarantee you’ll find the perfect white elephant gift, as well. The great thing about shopping on foot? You’ll be able to tuck into other shops, restaurants and bars that I either forgot to name or haven’t discovered for myself. Happy holidays to you all — see you downtown in 2023!\n",

      "Kaitlin Morrill feels the same way about Christmas as a certain green grouch. “I have very similar feelings about Christmas,” Morrill said. “I’ve been called the Grinch in my own family. I’m 100% on board with Cindy Lou Who’s take on Christmas. ”Want to go? \"Who's Holiday\" will be presented at 7:30 p. m. Friday and Saturday at Studio 124, located at 124 S. Main St. Tickets: $15.   A Christmas pub crawl will be held at 9 p. m. Friday and Saturday and begins at Studio 124. Cost: $15.   A pass for both events is available for $25. For tickets, go to https://www. showtix4u. com/events/17275. Details: 417-622-6470. Morrill will star in a one-woman Christmas show presented by Dream Theatre Company, a Joplin-based acting group, this weekend. “Who’s Holiday” offers a continuation of events in Dr. Seuss’ holiday classic “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” from the perspective of Cindy Lou Who, the little girl who caught that mean old monster in his act of burglary. In “Who’s Holiday,” Cindy Lou is all grown up and ready to talk about her side of the story — and all the other things in her life that have happened. Her life has had more than a few Yuletide tragedies and tribulations, and Cindy Lou shares them all. “All of the bad things that have happened to her have been on Christmas Eve,” Morrill said. “That’s why she tends not to like Christmas so much. But she has an inner hope that things will get better, so she tries to show holiday spirit and always ends up getting burned by it. ”The production is a dark, adults-only comedy filled with raunchy jokes and alcohol. It juggles comic cynicism with a satire of Dr. Seuss’ legendary rhymes — nearly the entire play features the familiar cadence of Seuss’ poetry. The tribute was not received well by Dr. Seuss Enterprises. It tried to shut down the production after its release in 2016, arguing copyright infringement, according to Playbill. com. In 2017, a judge ruled that the play’s lampooning was allowed. Dream Theatre, which bills itself as “alternative theater” and produces other renegade plays such as “Cannibal: The Musical” and “Evil Dead,” presented the play last year, and brought it back for a return engagement after demand from attendees and delight from company members. “It was popular,” said Becki Arnall, founder of the group. “We were shocked by that. Everyone in Dream Theatre adored it, and it sold out after word-of-mouth got out. ”This year’s show marks Morrill’s first chance at the character. Despite the reliance on vices and her living arrangements, Cindy Lou brings a brightness and optimism to her situation that was inspiring, Morrill said. “The thing that surprises me most about Cindy is her tenacity,” Morrill said. “I see a very battered woman, where life kept knocking her down, but she learned to pick herself up and keep going. She doesn’t let anyone or anything stop her from living life. ”Morrill, an actor since childhood, paused the craft out of high school: She enlisted in the U. S. Navy and worked as a mechanic at the Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program — Top Gun. Since her honorable discharge about 10 years ago, she has returned to the stage. She has been a cast and crew member of other Dream Theatre productions, including “Chicago,” and as an assistant director for “The Rocky Horror Show. ”Her take on Cindy Lou, she said, emphasizes the emotions behind events, from heartbreaking pauses to hilarious jokes. “Mine is a bit more of a dramatic take, with some really funny moments,” Morrill said. “Which is how I live my life, normally. I’m connected to Cindy in that aspect. Life sucks, but get up and take some dark humor along with it. ”Christmas pub crawlDream Theatre is also hosting a special Christmas-themed pub crawl this weekend. The Christmas crawl is more of a guided tour than a traditional pub crawl. Between stops, participants can hear carolers and stories about Joplin’s history told by actors dressed in Dickens-era attire. The party will be led by notorious Christmas flip-flopper Ebenezer Scrooge. Arnall said the idea happened at the request of two of the stops: Chaos Brewing Co. and Main Street Axe Co. “We were approached by Chaos in October wondering if we could do a haunted pub crawl,” Arnall said. “Afterward, Main Street Axe called us and asked to consider doing one for Christmas. ”Chaos has a treat for crawlers: It will offer a cinnamon bourbon fizz cocktail, a special creation for the holidays. Main Street Axe will offer demonstrations. The other two stops on the tour are Blackthorn Pizza and Pub and Hackett Hot Wings. \n",

      "A woman and a boy from Purdy were injured in a two-vehicle crash at 5:08 p. m. Wednesday on County Road 1070, about 2 miles south of Monett in Barry County, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. One of the drivers, Carol A. Stockton, 65, was taken by ambulance to Cox Medical Center South in Springfield with serious injuries. A passenger in the other vehicle, a 6-year-old boy, was taken to Cox Monett Hospital with minor injuries. Stockton was driving a northbound car that was struck head-on by a southbound vehicle driven by a 17-yerar-old boy from Purdy that crossed the centerline, the patrol said.

      "Steven Goodman told a Jasper County Circuit Court jury Thursday that he pushed his Carthage neighbor, Jack Davis, off his porch two years ago because he felt threatened. Goodman’s explanation of his behavior and his attorney’s argument that he had a right to defend himself left a jury of seven women and five men deliberating for several hours into the night Thursday at the conclusion of a two-day trial in Joplin. Goodman, 58, is charged with first-degree assault of Davis, 62, in an incident in their East Centennial Street neighborhood. Davis testified the first day of the trial that he walked across the street to Goodman’s home and knocked on his door wanting to know what Goodman had done to scare his granddaughter “half to death” in asking her to turn down the music she was playing in her car. Goodman and his attorneys maintained at trial that he never said a word to her because she turned the music down as he approached her vehicle. Davis testified that Goodman answered his knock a short time later and that Davis no sooner asked if he said something to his granddaughter to scare her than Goodman admitted that, yes, he had, and stepped out the door and shoved him over his porch railing into some bushes. Goodman claimed Davis’ voice was raised when he came to his door, causing him to sense a threat to his own well-being. He went on to explain that he did not actually push Davis over the railing but just in the direction of the steps he came up, and that Davis then staggered backward down a couple of those steps toward a landing before tumbling over the railing. Defense attorney Jared Stilley told jurors during closing arguments that his client had “an absolute right to protect himself,” especially in his own home when he sensed he was about to be attacked. “Are you supposed to wait in your house until you get hit and then you have a right to defend yourself?” Stilley asked derisively regarding the prosecution’s case. Assistant Prosecutor Taylor Haas sought to undercut Goodman’s self-defense claim on cross-examination, getting him to acknowledge that Davis never took a swing at him or did anything else of a physical nature to warrant the shove. Haas also elicited an acknowledgement that Goodman did not even bother to ask Davis to leave before shoving him. Haas further pressed the defendant as to why he failed to mention to the police officer called to the scene anything about feeling threatened by Davis when the officer first spoke to him that night. It was only later, after he had been arrested, that he decided to tell the officer that he “felt like it was going to be a threatening situation. ”Goodman explained on redirect examination by co-defense attorney Jay O’Donnell that the confrontation on the porch all took place in just seconds and that he was in a “stunned” state of mind, or shock, when he was speaking with the officer. “It just didn’t seem real,” Goodman said. “I don’t really know how to state it any other way. ”Assistant Prosecutor Nate Dally told jurors during closing arguments that the defendant’s own admission that he was the initial aggressor disqualifies him from the protection afforded a self-defense claim. The defendant was mad about the granddaughter’s music, Dally said. That was “the basis of his assault,” he said. Some proof of his intent to injure Davis could be detected in what he told the female neighbor who came to the aid of Davis, Dally said. That neighbor told police the day in question and testified Wednesday that Goodman told her to get Davis off his property or he would “finish him off. ”“You don’t ‘finish (somebody) off’ you haven’t already injured,” Dally argued. Jurors were given five verdict options in addition to the option of acquitting the defendant on the grounds of self-defense. The charge he was tried on was first-degree assault, which required a finding of intent to cause serious injury to someone 60 or older. The state also requested that the jury be given the options of second-degree or third-degree assault. Second-degree assault required a jury finding that the defendant recklessly caused serious injury to someone 60 or older. Third-degree assault was defined for the jury as knowingly causing physical injury to a person of that age. The defense sought and was granted the inclusion of two misdemeanor verdict options of fourth-degree assault, for either recklessly causing physical injury to Davis, or knowingly causing physical contact with him. Stilley, who tried to raise doubts about the severity of Davis’ injuries throughout the trial, told jurors that Goodman has never been in trouble before and described his client as a Mister Rogers type. “This is a meek guy,” he said. “This is not a confrontational guy. ”Haas summed up the state’s position on final rebuttal, reminding jurors that an emergency medical technician had described to them how Davis suffered three hematomas the size of golf balls as well as a laceration to the top of his head that bled for hours and caused a serious drop in blood pressure during transport to a hospital. The wound, which required three stitches and five staples to close, was deemed life-threatening in the estimate of the paramedic. Haas told the jury that Goodman was prepared to “make good” on his threat to “finish off” Davis when he went behind his house to retrieve a can of gasoline. “His plan was to light his neighbor on fire,” Haas told them. \n",

      "CoxHealth, the Springfield-based health system that operates hospitals in Lamar and Monett, will offer several COVID-19 vaccine clinics this month in rural Southwest Missouri. The clinics are made possible by a Health Resources and Services Administration grant, which is part of the Rural Health Clinic Vaccine Confidence Program. The federally funded program aims to increase vaccine confidence and uptake, improve health care in rural areas and provide education and outreach about vaccine benefits and safety. At all local clinics, the Pfizer vaccine will be available for individuals 12 and older. Both initial and booster doses will be available. The clinics will be held:• From 10 a. m. to 2 p. m. Friday at CoxHealth Center Crane, 102 Cortney Lane in Crane. • From 10 a. m. to 2 p. m. Wednesday at CoxHealth Center Mount Vernon, 10763 State Highway 39, Suite 199, in Mount Vernon. • From 10 a. m. to 2 p. m. Thursday, at CoxHealth Center Shell Knob, 25376 State Highway 39, Suite M300, in Shell Knob. • From 10 a. m. to 2 p. m. Friday, June 10, at CoxHealth Center Aurora, 106 Commerce in Aurora. • From 10 a. m. to 1 p. m. Friday, June 17, at CoxHealth Golden City Clinic, 403 Main St. in Golden City. • From 2 to 6 p. m. Friday, June 17, at CoxHealth Medical One Clinic, 29 NW First Lane in Lamar. • From 2 to 6 p. m. Friday, June 24, at CoxHealth Monett Clinic, 1000 Highway 60 in Monett. A little more than half of Jasper County residents 5 and older are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But moving outside of Jasper County, those numbers drop, significantly in some cases. According to the CDC, the percentage of residents 5 and older who are fully vaccinated is 27. 7% in Newton County, 35. 5% in Barton County, 36% in McDonald County, 41% in Lawrence County and 47. 6% in Barry County. The level of community spread of COVID-19 is currently low in all of the Four-State Area, according to the CDC. \n",

      "Local residents can learn the status of Joplin’s applications for federal grant money and the work to bring more broadband internet service to the city during a Monday night meeting of the Joplin City Council. City officials at an earlier meeting had prioritized 20 major city projects to apply for funding through the American Rescue Plan Act. A consultant to the city on the ARPA applications and city staff had conveyed in September that Joplin had been awarded ARPA and other state and federal grants that might provide nearly $57 million in project money for a variety of purposes. At that time, grant applications had been filed for Joplin for extensive stormwater drainage work in the East Town neighborhood and the neighborhood around 17th Street and Annie Baxter Avenue, along with a drainage culvert project for the Crossroads Center Business and Distribution Park. Also in the works as of that discussion was a Missouri governor’s cost-share grant application for the widening of the Zora Street from Range Line Road to Missouri 249 plus the Dover Outdoor Recreation Area bike park, and funding for equipment for the police and fire departments. Leslie Haase, the city’s finance director, said at the September meeting that because the grant announcement draws so many applicants, city staff will file them quickly because the grants are made on a first-come, first-served basis. “The goal of all of this,” she said, “is to try to maximize our award of $13. 8 million to leverage additional federal, state and county awards with the end goal of saving local tax dollars” and to do projects that may not happen without the additional grant funds. Mayor Doug Lawson said then that Joplin residents send a lot of money to the state and the federal government in taxes “and I appreciate you trying to bring some of it back because it belongs here. ”In the effort to bring a $17 million fiber-optic backbone for broadband service to Joplin, the consultant for the project, Alvarez & Marsal and Capital Projects LLP, was to issue a call for proposals in November seeking responses for any business interested in developing broadband service here. Responses to the call for proposals are due in January. Earlier in the project, 16 internet service providers indicated interest in looking further into providing service to Joplin, the council was told by city staff. In other business, a presentation also will be made on the new solid waste master plan that has been worked on since December 2021, and the panel will hold public hearings on four zoning requests. \n",

      "A request for proposals to build a fiber broadband service in Joplin has been issued and is hitting the market at a good time, the Joplin City Council was told Monday night. “We are getting tremendous interest,” said Riz Shah, an adviser with Alvarez & Marsal and Capital Projects LLP, the consultant for the project. The proposals are due by the end of January. At that time, the consultants will compare the proposals and weed out those that do not meet Joplin’s needs, said another adviser, Jack Schaller, vice president of Olsson, an engineering company in Joplin. He said the consultants have worked with city departments to determine the details of service that would best serve Joplin and connect residents to the internet at the lowest cost. The city will consider proposals in which internet service providers would invest in partnerships to bring service here or structures in which the city contributes to the funding but not any proposals in which the city would be asked to pay all the costs, Schaller said. The council was told that questions about the request for proposals are due from interested providers by the end of this week. Once the proposals are received and examined, interviews with those who submit them are to be conducted in late February or early March. Mayor Pro Tem Keenan Cortez asked the consultants if it’s a buyer’s market right now in the industry. He said that it looks like Joplin is getting a generous response and might be in a good position in next six to nine months to obtain a good service at a reasonable cost. He was told the amount of interest would suggest that result. Councilman Phil Stinnett asked the city manager if council members would have input before they are asked to approve a deal. He would like to have input before a final agreement. City Manager Nick Edwards said if there is something that is not meeting community needs, the city staff can discuss that with the council. Stinnett said the priority in the beginning of the project was to obtain internet access for schoolchildren citywide. He does not want to see the broadband service get overloaded with special interest or business use so much the city cannot achieve the original purpose to provide reasonably priced access to residents and families. In other business, a final report on the status of the Solid Waste Master Plan was given at the meeting. Joplin residents could see some changes to trash and recycling services in the future if the city adopts the recommendations that are coming in the Solid Waste Master Plan. Though a new trash and recycling contract is more than three years away, consultant Julie Davis with the firm of Burns and McDonnell said that a shift from voluntary curbside recycling to making curbside available to all residents will be a final recommendation. That recommendation is intended to take more materials that can be recycled out of the trash that is dumped in landfills. She also said that to keep trash and recycling prices as low a possible, the report recommends that the city reduce bulky item frequency and limit quantities of bulky items that can be discarded. Also recommended is that the city’s recycling center be moved to a site where it can be operated next to tree limb and leaf disposal so that residents can use all of those services in one visit. The cost to build a new recycling center with the combined sites would be $3. 2 million, Davis said. Late in the meeting, the council was conducting a public hearing that drew numerous residents in support of the operation of the CODA Concert House at 2120 E. 24th St. , where house concerts are presented. The council was to determine whether a special-use permit would be issued for continued use of the property as a concert house and whether any special conditions would be imposed because some people testified at a previous meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission that there was noise and traffic issues with the site in a residential neighborhood. A number of people, including neighbors, said that none of those nuisances have resulted with the concert house. \n",

      "The Joplin Globe publishes summaries of routine and follow-up inspections performed by the Joplin Health Department. Businesses that are inspected either pass or fail based on violations found during the time of inspection. Those violations fall into two categories:• Priority violations are more severe and deal with improper food handling, storage and preparation. The Globe lists the number and summary of each violation. • Core violations are less severe and deal with equipment, maintenance and general cleanliness. The Globe publishes only the number. A failed inspection can result in a variety of corrections based on the types of violations found. Full copies of each report are available from the Joplin Health Department.

      "With their large collection, Jay Brown and Julie Taylor could have just as easily opened a furniture store. Instead, the couple opened a bar. “My wife and I both love the ’70s,” Brown said. “I lived through them; she caught the tail end of them. ”Downtown, Alisha Davis set up a place where her favorite R&B classics and other dance jams from the ’90s could be played loudly and proudly. “I have always had a love for this music,” Davis said. “I wanted to make somewhere for people in my generation. ”The two new Joplin bars celebrate two distinctly different decades of pop culture. The Living Room is all about the ’70s, including the furniture, decoration and drink offerings, while Xscape offers a large dance floor where people can enjoy some steps from the ‘90s. That ’70s flowBrown’s and Taylor’s collection of midcentury and retro furniture is part of the charm of The Living Room, which opened in October at 1802 S. Main St. While it offers a typical bar for drinks, the rest of the space is filled with comfortable couches and chairs arranged into miniature dens, where participants can lounge. The bar features a significant collection of memorabilia from the decade as well, from home decorations to vintage Missouri Southern State University and Ozark Christian College yearbooks. Shelves are filled with ceramic cats, era magazines, eight-track cassettes and rotary phones. Patrons can use a Ouija board or a Magic eight ball to divine any questions. Macrame curtains and deco art hang from the walls. Brown said the couple had a blast curating the items in the bar to the point where they wondered whether they would also be a museum. “The things here have a lot of little subtleties,” Brown said. “There is something for everyone to key in to, whether they lived through the decade, or read about it, or saw something in their grandmother’s house. ”The bar’s drink offerings are also from the era, right down to the large bottle of Galliano used to serve Harvey Wallbangers. “Once you see it, you see it’s a very ‘70s bottle,” Brown said. Bartenders will also pour you a Tom Collins, a rusty nail, an old-fashioned or other era-specific cocktail. The couple love the era so much that they bought a midcentury Joplin house of their dreams, moving from Glendale, California. The house became a showcase for their furniture, Brown said, as they swapped out pieces. The environment has been used by customers as a makeshift brunch location, Brown said. People can bring their own entrees and enjoy the bar’s drinks and selection of soul and gospel ’70s music. They can also enjoy punch bowls of drinks for their own birthday parties or other groovy celebrations. The owners are still getting a feel for their niche, Brown said, but have been encouraged by the turnout. “We’re still discovering our space, and people are as well,” Brown said. “We’re just seeing what works for us. ”Party like it’s 1999Davis didn’t double down on the decade through decoration. Xscape, located downtown at 532 S. Joplin Ave. , has a wide open dance floor featuring cutting-edge lights and a strong sound system, allowing customers to bust a move such as a Roger Rabbit, Cry Baby, Running Man or Diddy Bop — or just a simple Cabbage Patch at the table. Large pictures of the Notorious BIG and Tupac survey the moves. The venue puts its focus on the music, sticking with pop and R&B standards from the ’90s, spilling over into the early 2000s. Davis, a former co-owner of Whiskey Dicks, said she is a particular fangirl for the girl groups of that era, and also had a special appreciation for Mary J. Blige. Hearing those songs from her favorite era in area bars is not easy to do, she said. “I grew up with that era of music, and it’s really hard for women and men my age to find somewhere they can dance to the music they know and love,” Davis said. “A lot of new stuff is hit or miss with an older crowd. ”The bar offers a happy hour intended for service industry employees. Instead of the middle of the afternoon, it is set an hour or so before last call. This gives the opportunity for those who work later to still enjoy an evening out. Davis said the venue will also expand entertainment offerings with drag shows. It is also available for private parties such as baby showers and wedding receptions. \n",

      "Jack Davis told a jury Wednesday that he crossed the street to his neighbor Steven Goodman’s house in Carthage two years ago to question him about the manner in which he asked his granddaughter to turn down her music. Davis said Goodman answered the door when he knocked. But Davis had barely managed to ask him what he said to scare his granddaughter when Goodman shoved him backward over a railing and off his porch. A probable-cause affidavit filed in the assault case alleges that Davis, 62, fell about 5 feet and struck his head on the corner of a concrete step. But that claim was at issue the first day of his 58-year-old neighbor’s trial in Jasper County Circuit Court. Davis acknowledged that he did not know how he sustained the injury to the top of his head. He believed he fell in some bushes and ended up on his feet in Goodman’s driveway. “I was confused,” he testified. “I didn’t think I was in pain, but I had blood running (down) my face. ”It was the serious nature of the injury and what Goodman did next that raised the assault to the level of first degree in the estimate of local law enforcement, as the opening statement of Assistant Prosecutor Taylor Haas made clear. Taylor told jurors that Goodman informed another neighbor who witnessed the incident and came to the aid of Davis: “If he’s not off my property by the time I get back, I’m going to finish him off. ” He then went around the corner of his house and returned with a can of gasoline, Haas said. The witness helped Davis back across the street, where he lay down in some grass while an ambulance was called to take him to a hospital. The witness testified Wednesday that she thought Goodman also had a lighter in his hand when he came back with the gasoline. Lt. Eric Miller, with the Carthage Police Department, who arrived on the scene before Davis was taken to the hospital, testified that he asked Goodman what he was intending to do with the gasoline. A body camera video of Miller asking Goodman that question recorded the following response: “You really want to know? I was going to gas him up and light him. ”But defense attorney Jared Stilley told the seven women and six men picked as jurors for the trial there are a number of inconsistencies in the accounts of the state’s witnesses as well as reasons to question the adequacy of Miller’s investigation and the purported seriousness of the victim’s injury. Stilley said Davis’ granddaughter regularly parked her car on the block of East Centennial Street where the two men live with her music thumping and blaring. On the day in question, his client started to approach her to ask her to turn it down. But before he ever said anything to her, she turned it down, and his client went back to his place, Stilley said. But the girl told her grandfather that Goodman scared her “half to death,” setting in motion all that ensued, the defense attorney said. He pointed out to jurors that Davis was not invited to Goodman’s home, that the porch on which the confrontation took place was quite small and that Davis got in Goodman’s face and was yelling at him. According to Stilley, Davis’ account as to how he fell changed as to whether he was pushed over the railing or tumbled backward down the steps and that police failed to investigate that discrepancy. They also never took any photos of Davis’ injury, which required no more than three stitches and five staples, Stilley said. He was released from the hospital within a matter of hours, he said. Under cross-examination by Stilley, Davis acknowledged that he no longer recalls exactly what he said to Goodman when he came to the door. But he denied ever saying that he lost his footing and tumbled backward down the steps of the porch. “He pushed me to the railing . . . the railing,” Davis testified under questioning. “I tumbled over the top of the railing. ”The trial resumes at 9 a. m. Thursday at the Jasper County Courts Building in Joplin. \n",

      "A 28-year-old defendant was granted suspended sentences and probation when he entered an Alford plea Monday on three of five felony counts that he was facing. Tanner L. Enochs entered the plea in Jasper County Circuit Court on counts of possession of a controlled substance and unlawful use of a weapon in connection with an arrest on July 31, 2020, and to second-degree burglary related to a break-in Jan. 6, 2020, at Sutherlands Building Material business in Joplin. Felony counts of attempted theft of a motor vehicle and property damage related to the Sutherlands burglary were dismissed in the defendant's plea deal. An Alford plea admits no guilt but acknowledges the probability of a conviction if the matter were to proceed to trial. Judge Dean Dankelson accepted the plea agreement and assessed Enochs terms of five years each on the possession and burglary counts and four years on the weapon conviction with execution of the sentences suspended and the defendant placed on supervised probation for five years. Enochs was also ordered to pay $2,802 in restitution for items stolen and property damaged in the Sutherlands break-in. Police arrested him on the drug and weapon charges when an officer and a detective attempting to serve bench warrants on him located him in his backyard on North Oak Avenue in possession of a loaded handgun and 12. 5 grams of methamphetamine.   \n",

      "It’s like clockwork. Every year at Christmastime, I get on a rant about buying local, particularly locally created art. It isn’t as if there aren’t options for buying local art to fulfill your holiday shopping needs. It’s about pushing back the convenience and generic offerings of big box or chain stores and instead choosing to support local businesses, artists and the economy. Buying local is a conscious effort. It’s about contributing to the success of local artists and locally owned businesses, rather than lining the pockets of corporate profiteers who operate chain stores. It’s also about contributing to city sales tax revenue, which pays for city employees, including police and firefighters, and myriad city amenities. But it’s about more than investing in the local economy. It’s also about investing in a community’s identity and its quality of life. Buying local supports the distinct character of a community — in Joplin’s case its reputation as an art community. The more original art that is sold locally, the more it strengthens our reputation as an art community and our position as a shopping destination. Its long-term effect is the attraction of new businesses and entrepreneurs and the retention of workers. The nice thing about shopping in a burgeoning art community is that you can avoid the holiday chaos of shopping centers, malls and big box stores on traffic-congested commercial strips. Local galleries and studios are in the downtown district or off the beaten path, as are businesses such as coffee shops or restaurants that have exhibits of locally created artwork that can be purchased. Also away from the packed commercial strips are marketplaces such as Empire Market, where artisans sell their wares, and community art centers, such as the local Spiva Center for the Arts or Carthage’s artCentral. In addition to artwork sold in exhibits at these centers, Spiva has a gift shop with locally created art and artCentral hosts an annual holiday boutique featuring local artwork. This weekend is the final opportunity for shopping in the boutique. Generally, these locally owned businesses offer more personal customer service than chain businesses, plus they have firsthand knowledge of the artists whose work is in the business. If the right piece of artwork can’t be found in the business, the proprietors can connect you with the artists for an additional selection of artwork or for commissioning of a piece. If you’re needing a very personalized piece of artwork, these businesses can connect you with the artist. If you’re interested in a particular artist’s work that you can’t find in a local business, go online to find the artist’s website or Facebook page. Also, check the Facebook page of the Joplin Regional Artists Coalition. It posts images of the work of its members, many of whom are actively marketing for Christmas. What seems to stall people in buying local art is its cost. Yes, any original artwork will cost more than off-the-shelf reproductions. But you’re paying for the creativity of a truly unique piece that offers more value for the money than something mass-produced. There are ways to shave costs, though. Many artists recognize that not everyone has deep pockets, so they offer smaller, reasonably priced pieces — coasters, coffee mugs, cutting boards, pillows, scarves and more. Some painters sell giclees or prints that are reproductions of paintings, but with only a limited number. While you won’t have the only piece created, it’s better than posters that are printed by the tens of thousands. If you’re lacking in confidence in selecting a piece of artwork, there are always gifts of art that require no such choices. Buy a gift membership in Spiva or artCentral or a season ticket to Joplin Little Theatre, Dream Theatre, Stained Glass Theatre, Stone’s Throw Dinner Theatre, Midwest Regional Ballet, Heartland Opera, Pro Musica chamber music presenter or Connect2Culture Curtains Up concert series. There are also gifts of enrollment in art classes. There are offerings in a cornucopia of mediums at Spiva, Create N Sip Studios, Elements Gallery, and artists co-ops, which include Local Color Art Gallery and Studio in Joplin and ArtForms Gallery in Pittsburg, Kansas. Some artists offer classes within their studios. Painter and sculptor April Davis offers classes in a range of mediums at April’s Art House, east of Carthage, and clay artist Brent Skinner offers pottery classes at his studio, Skinner’s Pottery, north of Diamond. Here is a list of most of the places where you can shop locally for art: Spiva, Pro Musica, and Connect2Culture in the Cornell Complex, Seventh and Joplin streets; Create and Sip Studios, 223 W. Third St. ; Joplin Avenue Coffee Co. , 506 S. Joplin Ave. ; Urban Art Gallery, 511 S. Main St. ; Plant Parenthood 417, 528 S, Main St. ; Beast and Barrel restaurant, 530 S.

      "Joplin has a new RV dealership that’s up and running. Craig and Viktoriya Goldrich, who operate an RV dealership in Tulsa, Oklahoma, picked Joplin as a site for expansion. They are now transforming the former John Q. Hammons Convention and Trade Center into Joplin RV & Marine, 3535 Hammons Blvd. The deal to transfer ownership of the long-vacant trade center was handled by Alan Buttram, with Buttram Commercial Real Estate. With 30,000 square feet of space, this will be a massive undertaking, but the new owners see it as an opportunity waiting to happen because of its nearness to Sam’s Club and to 32nd Street Place, a $188 million mixed-used, retail and residential development on land east of Range Line Road and south of East 32nd Street. The structure will have a large indoor showroom to display recreational vehicles and eventually some high-end boats. To do that, the structure’s ceiling will be reconfigured to allow for a 14-foot clearance. The reworking of the structure will take some time. A grand opening is planned for March. In the meantime, a sales office has been set up in one of the campers moved to the site. Several models are now on display. Apparently, this business is off to a good start. Craig Goldrich said Joplin RV & Marine opened Tuesday and had its first sale the next day. The structure also will house a service department. “We will service what we sell,’’ Goldrich said. “We’ll have a state-of-the-art parts department. Right now, we’re hiring for everything from custodians to RV mechanics. ’’Bring your resume to the dealership and apply in person. Ask for the general manager, Kim Siex. Joplin RV & Marine will offer several brands of trailers and motor homes, including Alliance, Holiday Rambler, Winnebago, Gulf Stream, Keystone, Forest River and Shasta. The business also will offer used trailers, and has consignment programs for recreational vehicles and boats. During the pandemic of 2020 and 2021, sales of recreational vehicles skyrocketed, creating a shortage of RVs. Parts were affected, too. Goldrich said the industry is “back to normal. The shortages are gone. ’’New lookA longtime Main Street business, OK Bar & Billiards, 1516 S. Main St. , is getting a new look. The pool hall’s Main Street side has been upgraded with a new facade of gray stone and modern windows. The top half was recently painted black to complement the stone. The new look features a garage door-like opening that will let fresh air into a room that has been designated as “The Smokin’ Hole” by patrons. Amanda Love, who owns the bar with her mother, Jean Harmon, daughter of the original owner, said the improvements are not done yet. Plans call for an awning to be added to the front of the building. “We are a nonsmoking establishment. We added the room to accommodate the smokers,” she said. “Our customers gave it that nickname. It’s a good place to sit at a table, get some fresh air and watch Main Street. ”OK Bar & Billiards, a Main Street fixture since 1939, has a large number of pool tables, including some new ones, according to its website. It also has a restaurant that offers a wide range of sandwiches, appetizers and pizza. I have a special fondness for the OK. My father loved playing pool. The OK, he said, had the best tables and the best players. He had his own personalized cue. He was known there as “Lefty” because he was left-handed. When Jean Harmon heard me say his name, she said, “I knew Lefty. In fact, I’ve got a picture of him somewhere. ”That doesn’t surprise me in the least bit. I hope she can find it. \n",

      "It’s great to see Christmas lights and decorations popping up all over town, adding cheer and festiveness to the darkest days of the year. Here are several more reason to be cheerful:Union DepotAn engineer recently assessed the historic but long-abandoned train station and found that it is in good structural condition, according to Lori Haun, director of the Joplin Downtown Alliance, which obtained the study with a $5,000 grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the depot was designed by Kansas City architect Louis Curtiss and was built by the Manhattan Construction Co. of New York. It opened in 1911 as a passenger stop for the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The engineering report could help pave the way for redevelopment of the building because it reduces uncertainty about it. In addition, the DJA has applied for brownfield tax credits that could help private investment in the cleanup and rehab of the building. We appreciate all the hard work that went into the study and the effort to find investors and tenants, and are optimistic that it will soon join the downtown renaissance. Rapha InternationalThis week the group launched a campaign to increase the size and capacity of its Hope and Healing Center, which also will include an art therapy room. Joplin-based Rapha also is celebrating 20 years of serving survivors of trafficking, exploitation and abuse. It had previously opened an outpatient trauma therapy center at 712 S. Main St. in 2020, said Aryn Tanksley, director of programs and development. They have now acquired property at 2501 E. 20th St. in Joplin to house an expanded center that will allow it to serve additional survivors. Rapha’s goal is to raise $1. 2 million. Earlier this month, the Children’s Trust Fund of Missouri announced more than $19 million in grants awarded to 59 organizations throughout the state aiming to protect children from abuse and neglect, and Rapha received $462,853. This is a great cause worthy of supporting. Go to rapha. org/next-chapter to learn more. PSU PartnershipPittsburg State University announced partnership with Washburn School of Law in Topeka that will allow for faster degrees, saving time and money for those who are seeking law degrees. “We have inked a partnership that will allow students to complete a bachelor’s degree as well as a law degree in six years total — three years here at Pittsburg State, and three years at Washburn School of Law,” Chris Childers, director of PSU’s School of History, Philosophy and Social Sciences, said in a statement. Southeast Kansas is considered underserved when it comes to the number of cases on the books and the number of lawyers available. Kansas Supreme Court Justice Marla Luckert said in a statement: “We have a critical shortage of attorneys . . . especially in rural Kansas. ”This sounds like a great program. Well done!\n",

      "A Jasper County judge granted probation to a Duenweg man when he took a plea offer Monday on felony assault charges stemming from a 2020 shooting incident in Joplin. Keelan N. Hearns, 20, pleaded guilty in Jasper County Circuit Court to a count of unlawful use of a weapon in a plea agreement dismissing related counts of first-degree assault, armed criminal action and first-degree property damage and permitting a suspended imposition of sentence. Circuit Judge David Mouton accepted the plea bargain and placed Hearns on five years of supervised probation. The charges pertained to shots fired March 15, 2020, at an apartment at 1008 S. Connecticut Ave. A probable-cause affidavit stated that a witness saw a car stop in a parking lot outside the apartment and three men get out, two of whom approached the apartment. One of the men was carrying a handgun and fired five shots into the apartment, with one of the rounds passing through a living room window within an estimated 6 feet of the apartment occupant, according to the affidavit. An occupant of the vehicle later told police that Hearns fired the shots into the apartment. No injuries were reported in the shooting. \n",

      "Spirits were bright Tuesday night at the Joplin Christmas parade as more than 100 entries, many reflecting the “Christmas in Candy-Land” theme with lighted decorations, entertained families that lined Main Street for blocks to take in the festive occasion. The parade opened with a tribute to the two officers whose lives were lost March 8 when they were shot by a man they detained in the parking lot of a shopping center after a trouble call at a clothing store. The late Cpl. Benjamin Cooper and Officer Jake Reed were remembered as their families rode in police vehicles leading the parade. The tribute to them and the community’s first responders continued with the procession featuring the Joplin Fire Department Honor Guard and the parade’s grand marshal, police Chief Sloan Rowland, as well as METS Ambulance and the Duenweg Fire Department. The parade mixed all the ingredients that brothers Noam and Noah Miller, ages 6 and 10, respectively, wanted for the night. First, they were eager to get candy, Noah said. Noam wanted to see an Army truck and the boys also wanted to see a firetruck like the one their father, Stephen Miller, drives for the Joplin Fire Department out of Station No. 5. Many parade revelers, like the Miller brothers, came prepared to savor the parade comfortably by bringing chairs, blankets, food and drinks. The family of Sunday Walton even brought games and hot chocolate. “We’re very excited about the parade,” Walton said. “We’re normally in it with the post office (where she works), but this year we’re getting to sit down and watch it. We’re excited to see all the floats. ”The event was intended to please all the families who gathered along the street to do just like the Waltons and Millers. “We’re really excited at Freeman Health System to be sponsoring the 52nd annual Christmas parade,” said Paula Baker, president and CEO of Freeman. “And we have more entries this year than we have had in a very long time. We have over 105 entries, five marching bands, and there’s a great variety. I think people are really ready to get back out after COVID-19 and celebrate the holidays in style. and the best way to kick off the holiday is with the Joplin Christmas parade. ”The Freeman parade organizers were expecting a record crowd at the parade after a two-year hiatus because of the pandemic. “We know that people have their certain spots along Main Street that they gravitate to each year, and so people have already gone to their spots and they are anxiously awaiting the beginning of the parade,” Baker said. “You can feel the holiday spirit here tonight. ”As the lineup from 26th Street to 15th Street on Main Street began before 5 p. m. and participants decked out their entries, the crew of Kellison Academy of Martial Arts and Fitness Kickboxing added the final decorations to their Gingerbread Ninja themed float. A cloudy drizzle that turned to mist did not deter the 20 boisterous academy students from having a good time as they prepared to get underway on their Candy-Land board game-themed float, said Brandy Mann of the academy. Her daughter, Addy Mann, an 11-year-old double gold junior Olympic medalist in the sport, said, “I am feeling very cold and I also am very excited” about the parade. “I hope everybody likes them,” she said of the themed entries. Winners will be announced Wednesday, a Freeman spokesman said. \n",

      "One of Joplin’s oldest downtown businesses will close next month. Pearl Brothers Hardware Store will come to an end Jan. 28, 2023, when Harold Berger closes the doors of the business at 617 S. Main St. for the final time. “I started here full time when I graduated college in 1977, but I was here in the summers before then,” Berger said while sitting on lawn furniture that was available for sale in the store. “I’m 67 years old, and it’s time. I have some health issues. . . . Being on my feet for 50 years has caused bad hips, bad knees, bad back. It’s just time. It’s getting too much for me anymore. ”Sawyer Smith, with Blue Haven Investments and Homes, said Wednesday he has a contract to buy the building. His company is also buying the name Pearl Brothers, and plans to use it somehow when they renovate the building. “The top two stories are just being used as storage, so we want to use those for either commercial or residential space,” Smith said. “Then we’re going to renovate the bottom floor area. It’s going to be some form of retail, honoring that legacy of what’s been there, but we don’t have solid concrete plans on what exactly is going in down there. I can’t say how we’ll use it, but we were intentional in buying the Pearl Brothers name. That will be part of it. The building will always be known as the Pearl Brothers building for sure. ”1905 rootsBerger said his father, Joe Berger, and grandfather, Jake Berger, bought the hardware store in 1949 from Gus and Dave Pearl, who opened it in 1905. “That was an established name, so we kept the name. ” Harold said. The hardware store was at 220 S. Main St. for 60 years before Joe Berger moved it to its current home in March 1965. Harold Berger took over management from his father upon graduating from college, but Joe Berger was still a common sight around the store until his death in 2013. “He was here until about four days before he died at 93 years old,” Harold said. “He was still coming down here. He’d talk to people or fall asleep, one of the two. But if he hadn’t have done that, he’d have died years ago. It gave him something to do, got him out of the house, kept his mind functioning. He lived a great life. He may not have been able to tell you what he ate for lunch, but he could tell you all about his World War II stories. ”Harold said the store survived many challenges in the 1970s and 1980s, including when North Park Mall opened in 1972 and major retailers started opening up on Range Line Road. “The big boxes weren’t a thing back in 1964; that’s why we changed our product mix over the years,” Berger said. “We try to be as low a price as possible. We deal in a lot of special buys, closeouts, things that have differentiated us from the big boxes. You can still buy stocking stuffers here for as low as 29 cents, you wouldn’t get that anywhere else. The dollar store is a dollar and a quarter nowadays. Times have changed, obviously. I’m old enough that I don’t particularly care for change anymore. ”Berger said Pearl Brothers survived on customer service and offering items that couldn’t be found in the big box stores. They moved away from sporting goods and moved into outdoor furniture and worked to attract people from across the Four-State Area. “We were a destination spot. We attracted business from the whole Four-State Area,” Berger said. “If you draw from a 50-mile radius, there’s a third of a million people, and we would draw business from Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and still do. “We’ve run the sidewalk store every year even when it seemed like we were the only one down here. We put half the store out on the sidewalks. That’s our biggest day of the year. It’s usually the last Saturday in July, and people start asking about it in January. ”Berger said his health and technology have caught up with him and that no one in his family was interested in taking over, so he decided in March that it was time to close the store. “I was waiting for the right thing to come along, or what I felt like was the right thing to come along,” Berger said. “The name itself has been around since 1905, and that’s something I wanted preserved. I could have sold the building earlier in the year probably for a little more than I’m getting now, but I didn’t want to just sell the building, liquidate the stuff myself and walk away. ”Berger said there won’t be a closeout sale and that business will continue as usual until Jan. 28. “We will still be getting in new merchandise, we’re going to have things to meet the cold weather needs for people. In fact, we’re out today, but we’ll have more heaters coming in. ”Customers reactBeckie Wallace, of Webb City, was in the store Wednesday shopping with family visiting from Texas. She said she was saddened to hear that Pearl Brothers was closing. “I’m a regular here. I come in and buy stuff all the time, have for years,” Wallace said. “I love this store. It has a little bit of everything you need, and when I heard it was going out of business, I was sad, very sad. ”Wallace said she recalled when her parents would bring her to the store as a little girl. “As a kid, this was like a candy store. . . . ‘Look at this, Mommy, look at this! Can we have this?’ . . . I feel like I’m a real person in here and not just a code. You feel special, in other words. ”Geoffrey Mann, of Joplin, said he comes to Pearl Brothers for items he can’t find at other places. “Things like breaker switches and tools, things that are ordinarily extremely expensive or hard to come by,” Mann said. “Big box stores don’t have stuff like this a lot of times. I’ve been shopping here for years. Probably as long as I’ve been in Joplin I’ve dropped in for stuff every once in a while. It is handy, it’s an extremely handy store to have. There aren’t too many real hardware stores that are available anymore. This is a good place for it, and I’ve always been able to get to it. ”Smith said they plan to buy Berger’s stock and liquidate it after they close on the building. “Our plan is to restore it through historic tax credits,” Smith said. “In order to do this through historic tax credits, it’s in a historic district, but the sheet metal on the front makes it a noncontributing member, so our plan is to pull that sheet metal off and bring the facade back to its historic state and get it on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing member of the downtown historic district. ”\n",

      "Christian Jensen was hoping for a good start for Crumbl Cookies, a new storefront that he and his wife, Janci, have opened in the North Park Crossing shopping center. When asked what the opening has been like, he paused to reflect on the past two weeks: “It was kind of crazy. The show of support has been overwhelming. We are so grateful. ”The small shop, located south of the Jefferson’s restaurant at 430 S. Geneva Ave. , had people waiting in line for days in a row. When I visited the shop on Wednesday, there was a steady stream of people placing and picking up cookie orders. “When we opened, it was a continuous stream of people with a line out the door from the time we opened at 8 a. m. until we closed,” he said. “People know they can come here for a fresh cookie. ”All of the ingredients to make the cookies are fresh. They are mixed and baked in batches while you wait. Some are served warm. Some are served chilled. When they run out of a batch, a new one is introduced and posted on an electronic board. Most people select their cookies — there are usually six choices — at an electronic ordering station and pay for it there with a debit or credit card. You can order in person if you prefer to do that. A single cookie costs $4. 48. A box of four will cost you $14. 60. I chose a peanut butter cookie, two chocolate chip cookies and one with vanilla frosting. Crumbl Cookies has more than 200 flavors in its lineup. These are big cookies. How big are they? I used a measuring tape to determine that they were 4 1/2 inches across and more than a half inch thick in some cases. These cookies are so big that Crumbl Cookies will provide you with a plastic cookie cutter that divides a single cookie into four equal pieces for people who like to share their cookies. Well, isn’t that special — like I’m going to share my cookies. Jensen said they have had no trouble with hiring people to work in the shop. “We have about 65 employees right now with low turnover. We would like to have 70 to 75. We are always taking applications,” he said. Delivery, curbside pickup, catering and shipping is available via the Crumbl app and online at crumbl. com. If you are looking for a quick gift for a friend, these cookies are served in nifty pink boxes. Store hours are from 8 a. m. to 10 p. m. Monday through Thursday, and 8 a. m. to midnight Friday and Saturday. Indoor golfWhat is a golfer to do when the temperatures outside are in the single digits or the wind is howling at 40 mph?Well, you could visit The Golf Lounge at 422 S. Main St. and spend some time on a Trackman Indoor Golf simulator. This shop, located in the former Runaround shoe store, has simulators in two bays that are each available for $50 per hour. More than one person can play at a time. Mike Moudy, whose son Chris has opened this entertainment venue, gave me a tour of the place last week. While I was there, I watched a young man practice his swings. This guy could whack a golf ball into next week. It was impressive. It’s been a long time since I have heard the whoosh of a powerful swing. The simulator analyzed his shot and calculated how far the ball had landed from the hole on a huge screen that gives the golfer a view of the course that is similar to what he might experience in real life. “You can choose from more than 230 courses from across the world,” Moudy said. “They are adding three new courses a month. ”You can program the simulator to help analyze your swings and putts to improve your game. Golf, as a sport, has its ups and downs in terms of popularity. Apparently, it has been an up year for golf. I have golfed, but I am not a golfer. I asked Moudy if he could explain the attraction that so many have for this sport. “You go out and you play badly all day, and then on the last shot you bring it home. That’s what makes you want to go back,” Moudy said. The shop had its grand opening in late October when the weather was still somewhat favorable for outdoor golf. Now that winter has arrived, the place has been busy with bookings. Bookings may be arranged at golflouge417. com@gmail. com. Walk-ins are welcome, but calling in advance is recommended. Bring your own clubs. Hours are from 11 a. m. to 8 p. m. Sunday through Thursday, and 11 a. m. to 9 p. m. Friday and Saturday. \n",

      "LAMAR, Mo. — A 45-year-old man has been ordered to stand trial on eight felony counts filed on him a year ago in connection with an arrest for the beating of a minor over a six-day period. Daniel T. Williams, of rural Lamar, waived a preliminary hearing this month in Barton County Circuit Court and was ordered bound over for trial on counts of first-degree and third-degree domestic assault, armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and receiving stolen property and two additional counts of stealing. His arraignment in a trial division has been scheduled for Jan. 12. Williams is accused of repeatedly beating a boy over a six-day period in December 2021 at a residence along Missouri Highway 160 near Golden City. The boy told investigators with the Barton County Sheriff's Department that he was \"tortured all night\" by Williams after getting into some trouble. A probable-cause affidavit states that he alleged that Williams spanked him, hit him with a belt and punched him in the arm and stomach. Further investigation by the sheriff's office led to the alleged discoveries that Williams was a convicted felon in possession of four firearms, two of which he purportedly had stolen from the boy's family. \n",

      "If you’ve not yet had a chance to swing by the new memorial sculpture remembering the victims of the 2011 tornado, we urge you to do so. The 17-foot memorial is on the east side of the Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex, Seventh Street and Joplin Avenue. It contains the following inscriptions: “JMR. 161. May 22, 2011” along one side and “Run. Remember. Rebuild” on the opposite side. At the bottom of the sculpture the shape of a feather flag is attached horizontally, and it contains the names of those who lost their lives in the tornado. Our thanks to all those who made this happen, including Active Lifestyle Events, which commissioned the sculpture from Jorge Leyva. Clifford Wert, treasurer of the Cornell Complex, told us that the location of the memorial, even though it was not in the tornado’s path, is “a hallowed spot” because it’s near Joplin Memorial Hall, which served as a medical triage site in the hours immediately afterward. The site also has served as a beginning and ending point of the Joplin Memorial Run, an annual event to remember those who died in the tornado but also to recognize the strength the community and the volunteers showed as we rebuilt. Since the run began on the first anniversary of the tornado, about 25,000 runners have participated, according to Audie Dennis, president of Active Lifestyles Events, which coordinates the run, and about $400,000 has been raised, with a part of that set aside for the sculpture and the rest distributed to area organizations and used for rebuilding. This is a fitting way to remember the victims of the storm, and we applaud all those involved ion the campaign. If you haven’t already, swing by and take a look. Take a minute to reflect on the lives lost, the damage caused by that storm, and the tens of thousands of volunteers from the around the world who helped get this community back on its feet afterward. And if you haven’t already, sign up for the Joplin Memorial Run, on May 20, 2023. Go to https://www. joplinmemorialrun. com. Registration is open. \n",

      "Contracts to allow work on sewer system projects and to authorize a pay plan that incorporates the new position of assistant public works director have been approved by the Joplin City Council. Dan Johnson, public works director, sought approval of a change order for a construction contract with Rosetta Construction for work that is being done on the Joplin Creek interceptor replacement project. Johnson said additional problems with the large sewer main were found during the project. Four manholes need to be replaced because of corrosion and deterioration. One is only 30 inches wide but the others are 72-inch manholes. Most manholes are 48 inches wide, Johnson said, adding that it takes big equipment to make the large manholes. A Rosetta crew is working in an area where two sewer lines are located close together and as they were excavating one of the lines, they uncovered part of the other line and saw that the deteriorated condition of the manholes. “We decided (replacement) needed to be done because this is a very critical line to provide service to a large area of the city,” Johnson said. There are brick-lined manholes in the system where bricks are missing and the lids are so corroded the manhole lids do not line up anymore. The change order involves costs of $138,500 on top of the $2 million original contract. Council member Kate Spencer asked if the sewer lines are periodically checked. Johnson said they are, but it is not done often because it is expensive to dig up those large lines. It was about five years ago this one was last checked, he said. In other business related to work on the wastewater system, the council gave first-round approval to a $965,000 contract with Ace Pipe Cleaning Co. for repair and rehab of a management system called a toolbox that was created to take care of sewer collection system. Also advanced on first reading was a work authorization for $96,900 with Allgeier Martin and Associates for assistance with the rehabilitation project that Ace Pipe also will work on. The council was told that toolbox system updates the city’s GIS map of the system and provides information for permits that goes to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources regarding system operations. That information is then submitted by DNR to the Environmental Protection Agency. In other action, the council tabled a city pay plan that would have added the job of deputy public works director as part of a reorganization of the public works department. Finance Director Leslie Haase said that position is to be funded with savings from the city’s unfilled positions, which recently numbered more than 90 positions. Councilman Chuck Copple asked whether the pay listed in the plan for firefighter trainees and entry level firefighters and jail cook reflected the recent 4% boost in cost-of-living pay. He said some of the positions will be at a pay level below Missouri’s minimum wage when it increases next year. Haase said the city is still working on an internal equity study to place personnel in pay ranges that reflect the amount of responsibility and difficulty the employee faces. She said the city manager is still working on that plan and can provide more information in the future about pay status. Firefighters received the 4% cost-of-living raise but a new wage table for them has not been completed because they are still in union negotiations with the city, said City Attorney Peter Edwards. He suggested tabling the measure until the city manager is available to answer Copple’s questions. The city manager was out of the office at the time of the meeting. In a property matter, the council approved a contract to sell residential land at 2300 Golf Link Road in the Iron Gates neighborhood to Joplin businessman David Powell. The city had advertised the property for bids. The council approved the sale and staff said the transaction would be completed by Feb. 22. \n",

      "Joplin construction returned to tornado territory for the recent fiscal year. Construction in the city hit $224,548,386 for the fiscal year that ran from Nov. 1, 2021, to Oct. 31, 2022, according to city building permit records. Building permits filed with the city of Joplin in October indicate more than $18 million in construction for the month. The figures reflect only that construction taking place inside the city limits. In the previous fiscal year — Nov. 1, 2020, to Oct. 31, 2021 — building permits for Joplin reflected $168. 2 million in construction. Total building in Joplin the year prior, which ended Oct. 31, 2020, came to nearly $246 million, also rivaling the construction that took place in 2012 and 2013, when tornado building was taking place. From 2011 through 2013, construction in Joplin topped $200 million each year, as new schools, new homes, new stores, a new hospital and other buildings were erected. The largest permit in October was $9 million for a commercial addition at 3007 Stephens Blvd. , home of General Mills. Officials with the company could not be reached for comment. “General Mills’ building permit . . . is to expand the plant’s production space by approximately 35,000 square feet to support a capacity expansion project that will be rolled out in 2023,” the company said in a statement. “This investment represents General Mills’ commitment to growth within the North America Foodservice Segment. ”The 10 largest projects for Joplin this fiscal year are:• $34. 5 million by Springfield-based Ross Construction for new apartments from 3301 to 3329 S. Hammons Blvd. Officials with Ross and with Woodsonia did not return calls, but have previously discussed with the city their plans for that area that include tax increment financing for a $188 million mixed-use, retail and residential development called 32nd Street Place on land east of Range Line Road and south of East 32nd Street. Drew Snyder, president of Woodsonia Joplin LLC, previously told the Joplin City Council that construction would launch this year on multiple 12-plex and 86-plex villa-styled apartment buildings. The project also is to have a clubhouse, dog park and trail for its residents. Units should be available in late 2023 or early 2024. A planned home improvement store, Menards, is also to be built by the Menards company on land north of Sam’s Club and west of Hammons Boulevard, according to developers. Snyder also said in January that Menards owns property adjoining 32nd Street where other businesses and restaurants could be built. • $17 million by Redwood Development for apartments from 1906 to 1924 W. 20th St. In June, Redwood Development filed for seven permits for apartments construction on West 20th Street. Brett Mason, construction and development supervisor, said at the time that 144 units are planned, with a completion date forecast for fall 2023. He said they manage 138 properties with approximately 4,700 units in Missouri, Oklahoma and Kansas, with the largest portion of their housing portfolio residing in the Joplin metro area. They maintain an occupancy rate between 98% and 99% annually. “A housing shortage exists across our nation and Southwest Missouri is no exception,” Mason said in a statement when the permits were filed. “If we are building a project, most likely a housing needs assessment has already been done by the local municipality or other government agency, and a strong need already exists in that community. Many of these assessments conclude that more housing will continue to be needed into the future for years to come. ”• $10. 1 million for a new Freeman Health System medical office building at 3401 McIntosh Circle. The 30,169-square-foot, three-story office building will create office space so doctors can more conveniently meet and treat patients. Freeman officials said concrete was recently poured at the site. When done, the building will house dedicated, modern offices for physicians specializing in pain management, general surgery, urology and dermatology for now. The building itself, which sits within sight of Freeman Hospital West, also will offer a connector bridge with the adjacent Freeman Cornell-Beshore Cancer Institute for patients and a covered drop-off for patients on those rainy or snowy days. • $9 million for the addition by General Mills. • $6. 6 million filed by Missouri American at 1118 W. 21st St. It is for a high-service pump station that water company officials have said will pump water from the treatment plant on 21st Street into the distribution system. • $6. 2 million for restoration of the historic Olivia Apartments, 320 S. Moffet Ave. • $6 million for a new warehouse at 3015 S. Prosperity Ave. In a statement, Lowe’s said it is building what it called a “cross-dock delivery terminal for last-mile delivery of bulky items like appliances, riding mowers, grills and patio furniture. ” It will be run by Lowe’s in partnership with a third party and will provide 50 jobs. The 63,000-square-foot building will begin shipping in 2023 to customers in Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas. • $5 million for a new commercial warehouse for Expansion Industries at 8225 E. 23rd St. • $4. 5 million for a truck stop coming to 2101 S. Prigmor Ave. • $4. 2 million for a new fire station at 6720 E. 30th St. Home constructionCity building permits also reflect 167 permits for new homes, valued at $35. 2 million, or more than $214,000 per home. Ledford Construction also is continuing with its new homes in the 2800 and 2900 blocks of Nellie Mae Avenue. Sixteen permits were filed in August and September, valued at more than $3 million, for a project called Eagles Edge, a subdivision that could eventually hold more than 150 homes. It is located in the Wildwood Ranch area just off Central City Road, and it will be one of Ledford Construction and Development’s largest projects in its history. Homes will be 1,400 or 1,800 square feet — “depending on what the demand is,” Lance Ledford said during a recent ribbon-cutting — and will range in price between $200,000 and $300,000 each. Overall construction will span two years and the subdivision will consist of four streets. Also during the past fiscal year, a $1. 3 million permit was filed with an address of 406 S. Sergeant Ave. , where three historic homes are being restored as part of the Joplin Historical Neighborhoods Inc. project. \n",

      "A bridge on Range Line Road, which had closed the southern end of Joplin's busiest commercial corridor for more than two months, is now open, the Missouri Department of Transportation announced Wednesday. The replacement project is nearly a month ahead of schedule and just in time for the start of the holiday shopping season, officials said in a news release. A project manager working for Hartman & Co. , of Springfield, said the weather has been a key factor in the reopening ahead of schedule, with three rain days and 77 working days. The company, under the leadership of owner Dean Hartman, 89, Springfield, who personally visited the site on several occasions, committed the manpower and equipment needed at the start to demolish the existing bridge and advance the work at a rapid pace. The project manager said four crews — about 20 workers — have maintained that pace since the start of the project on Sept. 6. The project manager also credited the utility operations for moving as quickly as they did to relocate power lines and other services in the 2900 block of South Range Line. The fact that Kansas City Southern freight trains travel through the site did not interrupt the flow of work. Flagmen were posted on the tracks to alert workers about approaching trains, the manager said. The area under the bridge where the railroad passes through has been nearly doubled in width. That in turn has increased the span of the bridge over the tracks. MoDOT engineers have said the contract for the job specified that the contractor had 89 days from the day the street section was closed to finish the structural work. If the structural work was finished before the 89 days elapsed, MoDOT would pay a $20,000 incentive for every day the street was open early. Detail work can continue until completed, but the contract requires that the job be finished by Dec. 16. Built in 1976, the bridge was replaced because it has been deteriorating and has required numerous repairs over the last several years, MoDOT has said. It carries more than 24,500 vehicles a day. The project cost is $6. 2 million. The bridge was included in Gov. Mike Parson’s $351 million Focus on Bridges program, which will repair or replace 250 bridges across the state. Johnny Faucet, the project manager, was reluctant for his name to be used in print because so many others were crucial to the early completion of the project. But Hartman had a different view. \"He should get the credit,\" he said. \"He built it. He did it in 70 days when you take out the Sundays. That's just incredible. \"The new bridge is 2 feet higher and 15 feet wider than the one it replaced. The contractor also built new sidewalks on either side of the bridge. \n",

      "Same tasty treats and good service, but in a better location. Coley’s Cookie Co. has relocated to 901 S. Main St. It’s moved a couple of doors north of its former location. The cookie shop, soon to be a breakfast shop with a lot more activities, has occupied a corner storefront that is now much more visible from Ninth and Main streets. The shop, which has garnered a sizable following for its specialty cookies, opened on Tuesday, a few days earlier than Nicole Porter, the owner, had expected. “When they said it was ready, we moved right in,” Porter said. “We now have three times the space and a lot more room for seating. ”Plans call for the evolution of Coley’s Cookie Co. into something more than it is now. Eventually, the shop will offer outdoor seating and places for people to gather to play games. The shop will have a grand opening at 8 a. m. Saturday. The first 25 customers will receive swag bags or gifts that keep giving for a whole year. Hours are from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. Tuesday through Friday, and 8 a. m. to 4 p. m. Saturday. OpeningsAfter months of remodeling, the Waffle House, 3506 S. Range Line Road, has reopened with some of the same familiar faces in charge. The layout of the place has changed. It is much more open. The entrance is now more accessible to people with disabilities. The counters, booths and just about everything else inside are new. But the changes, for some reason, eliminated a few seats, so you might have to wait even longer to get a seat. Also open is Maria’s Mexican Grill and Cantina, 2850 S. Range Line Road. The restaurant relocated from a small storefront on East 32nd Street, which will soon be home to a new restaurant, El Caballo de Oro. Maria’s is one of the few places in town where your guacamole is prepared tableside. Margarita Ortega, an owner, told me: “It’s been a crazy two weeks. We have been so busy. It’s been good for us for training that the bridge was closed. We’ll be ready now when the bridges open. Hopefully, that will be soon. ”Ortega got her wish on Wednesday when Range Line was reopened after being closed for more than two months so that a bridge could be demolished and replaced. Santa arrivesSanta made his grand entrance on Wednesday in the J. C. Penney court at Northpark Mall. He will be there until Dec. 24. Hours will be from 11 a. m. to 2 p. m. and 3 to 7 p. m.

Holiday landscapesDowntown businesses have been preparing for the holiday shopping season by transforming their storefronts, windows and lobbies into festive landscapes. A contest organized by the Downtown Joplin Alliance is being held right now to let the public vote on their favorite decorations based on this year’s theme, “March of the Toys. ” Check them out and show your support for the efforts made by downtown merchants. The merchants are competing in three categories: best use of theme, best use of lights and most creative. Public online voting continues through Dec. 16. Competition winners will be announced and awarded trophies Dec. 20 in the lobby of City Hall. The decorations will help set the stage for the Joplin Christmas parade, which will be managed again this year by Freeman Health System. This year’s parade theme is “Christmas in Candy-Land. ” The parade will start at 6 p. m. Tuesday, Dec. 6, with a route from 15th and Main streets north to Second Street. \n",

      "David Sharlow cherishes the moments when his choral students for the first time hear how their voices sound in St. Peter the Apostle Catholic Church in Joplin. “You can just tell on their faces that ‘Oh, my goodness,’” Sharlow said. “They not only hear the sound but feel it. The older students who have been there already know, but it’s a special moment to see the faces of the new ones. ”Now in its 13th year, the Seasonal Choral Flourish will feature students from Missouri Southern State University’s chamber singing and concert chorale programs. Set for Saturday, the singers will offer performances at 2 and 7:30 p. m. at St. Peter the Apostle Catholic Church, located at 812 S. Pearl Ave. in Joplin. Members of the university’s brass program will perform instrumental 30 minutes before each of the performances. Sharlow, director of choral activities for the university, said that the selections of holiday music include classical pieces, jazzy interpretations and recognizable favorites. It will include traditions such as a processional and a closing blessing. The variety is not only for the benefit of the audience, Sharlow said. “There is that variety because we want the educational side for our students, and give them experience with classics,” Sharlow said. “There are some wonderful jazz arrangements of songs people already know, as well. ”A key component of the annual concert, however, is the location. Sharlow said it has been held at St. Peter each year except for one, when the church was being refurbished. The space has an outstanding acoustic treatment that gives the music quality and power, Sharlow said. He discovered the cathedral during his first year at the university and was hooked. Students rehearse mainly in the choir room on campus. They get only one rehearsal at the church before their public performances. That’s when Sharlow gets the chance to see the reactions of students hearing themselves in the space for the first time. “I can’t think of this program without being at St. Peter,” Sharlow said. “The acoustics, and the way they have it for the season makes it really nice. ”\n",

      "Groundbreaking held for new livestock handling facility at MU’s Southwest REECFrom MU College of Agriculture, Food and Natural ResourcesThe University of Missouri’s Southwest Research, Extension and Education Center (REEC) is poised to offer more public education and research opportunities with the addition of a state-of-the-art livestock handling facility. A groundbreaking ceremony was held Tuesday in celebration of the joint effort between the College of Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources (CAFNR) and MU Extension. “This one building is going to offer an incredible expansion of educational opportunities for our students, researchers and the community,” said Christopher R. Daubert, vice chancellor and dean of CAFNR. “Here, our students will get more hands-on learning experiences, and our researchers will have the best infrastructure to allow them to focus on what they do best — world-class research that is applicable on working farms throughout Missouri and moves the livestock industry forward. ”The facility, which will sit on the portion of the REEC north of I-44, will offer an indoor space for breeding activities like pregnancy checking, health care procedures such as vaccinations, and research data collection like blood draws. It will also feature an observation deck and add basic amenities like restrooms that do not currently exist on the portion of the nearly 900-acre REEC that sits north of I-44. “We are excited about this new investment at the SW-REEC,” said Marshall Stewart, vice chancellor for extension and engagement. “The beef industry is a vital part of Missouri’s economy. So, through this facility, MU Extension faculty will be better equipped to serve the needs of Missourians. ”In addition to conducting research, MU Extension uses Southwest REEC facilities to provide community education that helps area farmers improve practices and make their own farms more productive and profitable. “This is going to make our farm and our programs so much more accessible to the public,” said Jay Chism, director of the SW-REEC. “As a land-grant university, the ability to bring the knowledge of our researchers and faculty to the hard-working farmers of Southwest Missouri is truly rewarding, and this facility will make even more of that work possible. ”Chism looks forward to offering classes through MU Extension to area farmers that the REEC currently cannot support. These would include topics like artificial insemination in which a live demonstration would be key to learning. He also looks forward to seeing students being able to focus more on retaining information and less on dealing with mother nature. He recounted a story of graduate students using blankets to shield themselves from a snowstorm last year when pregnancy checks had to be done. “There’s not a lot of education going on at that point,” Chism said. “You’re just cold and miserable. ”MU Extension and CAFNR are working together to make this $400,000 facility a reality, and the groundbreaking marks the beginning of this project. The facility is expected to be completed by June 30, 2023. In addition to Daubert, Stewart and Chism, attendees heard from Missouri state Sen. Lincoln Hough and Missouri state Reps. Mitch Boggs and Scott Cupps as well as Jim Spencer, Southwest REEC Advisory Chair. The Southwest REEC was established in 1959; the site represents various soil types in this region on Missouri. Serving 22 counties, the center addresses the main agricultural concerns of area industries including beef, forage, and horticultural crop production.

New Will to Win movie meeting to be held at Will Rogers Memorial MuseumsFrom Kirkpatrick & Kinslow ProductionsClaremore, Okla. — Producers for a new movie featuring a Will Rogers character will be joined by acclaimed Author Jim Stovall, and Screenwriter Aaron Fulkerson with an update on the Will To Win movie, Saturday, December 3rd at 10 a. m. at the Will Rogers Memorial Museums, in Claremore. This event is free, and open to the public. The movie, now in development, is based on Mr. Stovall’s book with the same title. Will to Win is a female centric family friendly sports movie about Will Rogers High School student Sky Forest, who is devastated when softball is cut at Will Rogers High, threatening the promise she made to her Cherokee parents before they died to win a championship and secure a college scholarship. The school board president tries to sabotage her last option — pitching for the boy’s baseball team. Through her vivid imagination Sky enlists the help of Will Rogers, whose wisdom and humor helps her to discover the Will to Win. The movie is designed, in part, to reintroduce Will Rogers to current and future generations of people around the world. Filming is scheduled to begin in 2023. Planned locations for the movie include the historic Will Rogers High School in Tulsa, and other locations in northeast Oklahoma, including in Claremore at the Will Rogers Memorial Museums, Will’s birthplace in Oologah and along the Route 66/Will Rogers Highway corridor. Executives for the project, Russ Kirkpatrick and Andy Kinslow are producing from Tulsa, while Mark Heidelberger is producing from Hollywood, during development. The movie is the first ever to be endorsed by Will Rogers Family Representative Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry. It’s also endorsed by the Will Rogers Memorial Museums, and the Oklahoma Historical Society. PSU recognized as having Phi Kappa Phi Circle of Excellence Platinum ChapterFrom Pittsburg State UniversityThe Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi — the nation’s oldest and most selective collegiate honor society for all academic disciplines — recently recognized the Pittsburg State University chapter of Phi Kappa Phi as a Circle of Excellence Platinum Chapter, the highest commendation a chapter can receive from the organization.

Currently 87 percent of Missouri continues to face abnormally dry conditions, with many counties still experiencing moderate, severe, or extreme drought. Drought conditions are not expected to substantially improve this winter. “It will take a lot of precipitation to help Missouri recover from the current water deficit,” Governor Parson said. “Water for livestock is just as important in the winter as it is the summer, and we want to ensure resources are available to our farmers and ranchers that may need them. Additionally, with navigational challenges forming on Missouri’s rivers affecting barge traffic, extending our Executive Order is necessary to support continued mitigation efforts. ”On July 21, Governor Parson issued an Executive Order declaring a drought alert for 53 counties hardest hit by drought conditions. While conditions have improved marginally since that time, drought has continued to create challenges for our Missouri citizens. In response to Governor Parson’s initial Executive Order on this matter, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources activated the Drought Assessment Committee, a workgroup set up to assess drought levels and work with impact teams on response and recovery recommendations. The Agriculture Impact Team was assembled in August to coordinate response actions for the state’s agricultural community that has been impacted throughout this drought. In addition, following the most recent Drought Assessment Committee meeting, the Commercial Navigation Impact Team is being convened as well because low flow levels on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers are making it difficult for commercial navigators, such as barges, to maneuver through the rivers. The July Executive Order was set to expire on December 1. Extending it will allow the Drought Assessment Committee and associated impact teams to continue supporting affected communities throughout the winter and continue to expand the state’s capabilities to respond to and lessen the impacts of future droughts. Citizens can submit information about local drought conditions at Condition Monitoring Observer Reports (CMOR).

      "Dozens of people turned out on a chilly morning for the dedication of a sculpture honoring the 161 victims of the 2011 Joplin tornado. The sculpture, which is at the Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex, 212 W. Seventh St. , includes the names of the 161 people who lost their lives and will be a permanent memorial. The sculpture was unveiled by Active Lifestyle Events Inc. , which provides activities for the community, including the annual Joplin Memorial Run, held each year since the tornado. “This sculpture captures our organization’s dream of providing something significant to the community that also honors those we lost on May 22, 2011,” Audie Dennis, president of Active Lifestyle Events, said in an earlier statement. “This beautiful sculpture not only honors them, but the banner depicted recognizes the role the runners played in helping this happen. It is a fantastic piece of art, placed on the lawn of our arts and entertainment center that will lead our city into the future. ”A full story will follow later at joplinglobe. com. \n",

      "It was 2019 when the public last got the chance to enjoy a Christmas concert by the Duke Mason Band in Carthage and donate to the LaVerne Williams Christmas Party for Kids at the same time. The Steve Benjamin Memorial Concert, hosted by Mason and his musicians, will return on Sunday, Dec. 4, at a new time and new venue. Cheryle Finley, one of the organizers of the Carthage Police Department’s annual Christmas Party for Kids, said the concert is slated for 3 p. m. at The Lighthouse, 801 S. Main St. , Carthage. Doors open at 2:30 p. m. Traditionally, the concert had been held at Carthage Memorial Hall, but Finley said a scheduling conflict forced the move to the Lighthouse. “Admission is free, (and) we hope that people can bring a gift,” Finley said. “Our age group is from kindergarten through third grade. If you can bring an unwrapped gift for a boy or girl, or we do take cash donations, whatever you’re comfortable with. But we want everyone to come and enjoy the Christmas concert. ”In MemoryThe Steve Benjamin Memorial Christmas Concert is named for Duke’s father-in-law, Steve Benjamin, who was a well-known collector of anything having to do with Christmas before his death in 2008. “That was Stephanie’s dad,” Mason said. “He had, oh my goodness, a gigantic Christmas collection. The entire basement of his house was all Christmas from the big inflatables clear down to the little-bitty bells. Everything in between, plates, mugs, ornaments, any kind of toy you can imagine. ”Mason said he was introduced to the collection when he and his wife, Stephanie, were still dating. When Benjamin died, Mason said he and Stephanie went through the collection to take items that meant the most to Stephanie. The Steve Benjamin Memorial Christmas Concert is known for having large inflatable and other Christmas decorations around the stage. “There was no way we could take everything, there was just no way,” Mason said. “But Stephanie and I, we went through everything and she found a lot of stuff that was real meaningful to her and we kept all that. We still use a lot of that when we decorate for the Christmas shows in his memory. A couple of the inflatables we have are newer but some of them are his. We want to always make sure we have something of his on stage with us since it’s his memory. ”Christmas PartyThe Laverne Williams Carthage Police Department Christmas Party for Kids will follow at 9 a. m. Saturday, Dec. 10, at Carthage’s Memorial Hall. Finley said all the toys and money collected at the concert will go to the kids at the Dec. 10 party. “Every year we get so many wonderful gifts for the party, and it helps so much that we don’t have to buy the gifts, so we look froward to that and we appreciate that so much,” Finley said. “ We had the party in 2020 and 2021 but it was just a walk-through event, and we’re looking forward to getting back to something normal. “We’re doing it a little differently. We’ve requested applications online, and we’re limited it to 100 kids. We felt we could do a little more for each child with that number. So we’re looking forward to having 100 happy kids. ”Police Chief Bill Hawkins said the party had become complicated and unwieldy the way it was organized in past years, so the organizing committee decided to change it a bit. Applications were taken through a page on the city of Carthage’s website and the number of children accepted was capped at 100. “The changes really basically consist of the process in which the children are selected,” Hawkins said. “It was getting very complex the way we were doing it so the whole idea behind the changes was to make things easier in hopes that we could be of a bigger benefit for the kids. ”About Laverne WilliamsLaVerne Williams was a 31-year veteran officer and detective for the Carthage Police Department who took great pride in planning the Christmas party every year until his death just days before the 2009 party. “People don’t remember him — but those that do remember him as a kind, kind police officer, and we look forward to honoring him and continuing (his) legacy,” Finley said. “He enjoyed that so much and he enjoyed Duke’s concerts. He would get up and sing with Duke, and he and Duke became fast friends, so it means a lot to have both of these together. ”Hawkins is the last officer currently working for the department who worked with Williams. “He and I were very close friends,” Hawkins said. “We worked in the detective division together for several years. This party was something that meant a lot to him and it gives me great pleasure that we are continuing this tradition. ”\n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — The Christmas season is ramping up with a month of lights and fun coming to the Maple Leaf City. Carthage’s traditional Christmas celebrations are kicking off one at a time over the next week. • The Way of Salvation light display at the Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer complex at Fairview and Grand avenues, a tradition in Carthage since the 1980s, has opened. • Hometown Holidays, a Christmas village of inflatable slides, a plastic ice skating rink and other activities, located between Fifth and Sixth streets south of the square, also has opened. • Monday will mark the lighting ceremony for Sparkle in the Park, a dazzling free Christmas display that was started in Central Park last year and set up by the employees of Carthage Water & Electric Plant. • The light and music display at Mount Moriah United Methodist Church, about 10 minutes north of Carthage west of the corner of Nutmeg and Civil War roads, kicks off on Friday. • The lighting of the mayor’s Christmas tree on the Jasper County Courthouse lawn and Carthage Christmas parade are both Monday, Dec. 5. The tree lighting is at 6:30 p. m. and the parade starts at 7 p. m. Hometown HolidaysThis is the second year for Hometown Holidays. Abi Almandinger, an event organizer and director of Vision Carthage, expects a bigger and better event. “We have an ice skating rink that is bigger and more smooth, we’ve added curling (and) we have a gingerbread house for little kids, although really big kids can get in there, too,” Almandinger said. “The inflatable slide we had last year was called Snowzilla, and it was awesome. The one we have this year is called Mount Everest, and it is absolutely enormous. It may be close to 50 feet in the air. We also have the snow maze we had last year; that’s the same. We have way more decorations (and) we have free pictures with Santa every day, which is an improvement. ”Pricing is a little different and less complicated this year, Almandinger said. Visitors can get into the village for free and watch people play and skate and buy food from food trucks. People wanting to play on the inflatables or play curling will pay $5 per person for a wristband. Ice skating is an additional $5 for 45 minutes. Almandinger said the skating rink is bigger and better thanks to the city resurfacing the public parking lot at Sixth and Main streets. “It makes our skating surface quite pristine,” she said. The Hometown Holidays village will be open from 4:30 to 10:30 p. m. Friday and Saturday evenings through Dec. 24. It will also be open for the tree lighting and parade on Monday, Dec. 5. The village can also be rented for private events. Contacting Vision Carthage at 417-674-3328 for availability and pricing. People reactGreyson Cholley, 9, of Carthage, was one of the first people to get into Hometown Holidays on its first day. He said he had fun with the new inflatables, but he really liked the curling. “I did curling and first try made it on the bull’s-eye,” he said. “I didn’t push it way too hard, I just hit it medium and I didn’t realize I hit the bull’s-eye. My favorite thing is the curling. ”Cholley said he enjoyed the Mount Everest inflatable slide and the maze as well. “It’s scary going up it, but when you go down, you feel like you’re in heaven,” he said. “You go up the stairs and there are two sides, one’s light and one’s dark. I usually like the dark one because it feels like you’re in space. ”Maritza Murphree, 11, and Darcy Gomez, 9, both of Carthage, went straight to the skating rink before anything else on opening day. “Skating is the only thing I’ve done for now, but I’ll go do the other things after I’m done here,” Murphree said. “I really like the skating rink; it’s easier to skate. This isn’t real ice. When I go on real ice I actually trip a lot. ”Gomez said she was working to get the hang of the fake ice rink after not having been on ice skates for 11 months. “Last year was easier and this year is harder because I haven’t done this since last year,” she said. “I’m looking forward to the big tall slide. I think I’m going to throw up in there, but it’ll probably be fun. I like it because it’s going to go fast. ”Jeramy and Michelle McCauley, of Goodman, took son Jacob to check out the lights on the Carthage square and decided to check out the Christmas village. “We went to Precious Moments first to check that out, then we decided to come see downtown,” Michelle McCauley said. “We saw the lights on the courthouse and decided, oh, let’s go check this out. I would say we’ll definitely come back again. ”Horse and buggyWhen Robyn and Gary McLemore came to see Sparkle in the Park and the lights on the square in 2021, they decided they needed to be a part of this. The two own G&R Carriages, a horse-and-buggy business just outside Carthage that they’re looking to grow, and they decided giving buggy rides on the holidays in Carthage was a perfect starting point. “It’s been a dream of Gary’s for a few years,” Robyn McLemore said. “He’s wanted to give carriage rides at night around Christmas, and he wants to do weddings and things like that, too. ”Robyn McLemore said last week was kind of a dress rehearsal for them and their horses. The horses normally pull their buggies in the daytime, so they needed to see how they’d work at night. Rides will be offered on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays through the end of the year. The rides take riders on a romantic trip through time around Central Park and the Carthage square. Rides cost $25 for a couple and $40 for a family. The full ride, once Sparkle in the Park starts on Monday, will be about one mile and last between 15 and 20 minutes. \n",

      "The Jasper County prosecutor has dismissed a charge of promoting gambling that has been pending against the operator of a CBD business near downtown Joplin where police seized 23 gaming machines a year ago. The charges against Dinesh K. Sood, the owner of the Chill House at 501 W. Seventh St. , were dismissed at a hearing Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court. Jasper County Prosecutor Theresa Kenney said the charge was being dismissed in light of a statewide controversy over the legality of “pre-reveal” gaming machines seized at the Chill House. Kenney said the machines have been peddled to store owners in Missouri by their manufacturers with assurances that they are legal because they inform any customer who uses them in advance whether they will win or lose. The manufacturers maintain that, as such, they do not legally constitute games of chance. Customers are lured into inserting money in them by the prospect that the next play could be a winner with a payout similar to slot machines, Kenney said. State law requires a casino license to operate slot machines. Kenney said the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement agencies in some jurisdictions have been seizing the pre-reveal machines at businesses and arresting or citing their owners with promoting gambling. But prosecution of the charge can be problematic, especially proving that a business owner knew that they are illegal, Kenney said. Consequently, law enforcement has been spotty across the state, with some jurisdictions choosing to prosecute and others not, she said. She said local prosecutors have been waiting to see what happens with a Platte County case in which a conviction was obtained. If the case is appealed, a decision at the appeals court level could provide some guidance to local prosecutors, she said. Kenney said another factor in her decision to dismiss the charge on Sood, 42, of Rogers, Arkansas, was the defendant’s willingness to agree in writing that he now understands that the machines are illegal and that he will discontinue any use of them at his business. She said two other Jasper County cases have been brought to her by the state patrol that she has yet to file charges on. \n",

      "When a public project exceeds expectations, it is important to take note; the recent completion of the bridge replacement project on Range Line Road is worthy of such recognition. The work to replace a bridge that serves as a railroad overpass on the southern end of Joplin’s busiest commercial corridor finished nearly a month ahead of schedule and just in time for the start of the holiday shopping season, Missouri Department of Transportation officials said in a recent news release. While it is important to point out when public projects fall short and to call on officials to correct those shortfalls, we should be just as ready to recognize successes when projects run smoothly, quickly and finish early. Multiple levels of public and private responsibility were involved in the project: MoDOT, the city of Joplin, the railroads, utility companies and, of course, the contractors who built the bridge. A project manager working for Hartman & Co. , of Springfield, said the weather has been a critical factor in the reopening ahead of schedule, with three rain days and 77 working days. He said four crews — about 20 workers — maintained a rapid pace from start of the project Sept. 6. Fortune perhaps smiled, but surely that hard work and good planning deserve credit as well. Certainly the incentives for prompt completion served to encourage good planning and the rapid completion of the work. According to MoDOT, the contract for the job gave the contractor 89 days from the day the street section was closed to finish the structural work. If the structural work was finished before the 89 days, MoDOT would pay a $20,000 incentive for every day the street is open early. Coordination with the railroad and the utility companies was necessary to begin the work. Though the start date for the project was pushed back by delays in utility work when the utility companies experienced unexpected setbacks in delivery of materials, once the work began, it progressed swiftly. Detours around the location in the 2900 block of South Range Line Road caused frustrations for drivers and inconveniences for businesses in the area, as well as traffic management and enforcement challenges for the Joplin police. City officials and the Joplin City Council acted to install traffic calming devices requested by residents of the Sunnyvale neighborhood as traffic increased in the area of 36th Street because of the work. All of us are glad to see the bulk of the work completed so quickly. Kudos!\n",

      "Today is my birthday. No, I’m not expecting cards, gifts or anything of the kind, though I would never refuse a little chocolate. I’m celebrating a milestone birthday — the beginning of another decade for me, reflecting on what I’ve experienced and learned on my journeys. My morning has been spent watching the birds, contemplating the miracle of life continuing to go on in the midst of the unsettling, continual upheaval of our planet and wondering how (and why) I’ve made it this far. Yet, I persevere. So many thoughts are going through my head, and not quite seeing how to sort them out into words, I’m repeating (with timely rewrites) my column of my 75th turn around the sun. I don’t think I can sum it up any better this time around. Life has been a whirlwind tour, and I often wonder where the years have gone. There have been rich and wonderful gains, discoveries, heartbreaking losses and many valuable lessons along the way. Nevertheless, despite all life has taught me, as I once wrote in one of my journals: “I know nothing. All the knowledge I have is like being in a deep, dark forest at night, and seeing a faint glimmering of light a long way off through the trees — but there is a breeze, and the leaves keep shifting and obscuring the light so that I am not sure I am seeing it at all. That faint, flickering light is all I have of knowledge of the universe in its vastness. ”But author Arthur C. Clarke once commented, “Imagination is more important than knowledge,” and I certainly have more than enough of that. From earliest memory, I wanted to be a writer, to make gardens of words as much as I wanted to play in the dirt. I wanted to watch seasons change around me, to be friends with rabbits and snakes and lizards and spiders, to explore swamps and mossy berms, wade creeks and dance to songs of the trees. I wanted to shiver in delight with winter: watching the first snowflakes drift gently through the sky like down from Mother Goose’s feather bed, savoring the sharp North Pole taste of cold as it melted in my mouth, learning the secrets of each snowflake on my mittens and breathing the scent of earth refreshed and cleansed in January thaws. I thrived in soaking up the feel of summer sun turning my skin to golden tan. I loved the sticky trickle of watermelon juice down my chin, the tart sweetness of ripe wild strawberries, the pleasure of the sudden shock of jumping into a cool lake on a hot day, the itchy tickle of riding in loose hay on the wagon with snakes and bugs, the nutty flavor of raw wheat plucked from a hot, dusty field. I loved whiling away idle afternoon hours sorting through agates in glacial gravel piles, dropping them in jars of water to keep their pretty colors on my bedside table. My world consisted of either books or the outdoors, and often both at once. I had as teachers the likes of Somerset Maugham, William Shakespeare, John Steinbeck, Thornton Burgess, Carolyn Keene and Mother Nature to teach me the most valuable lessons of my life, which would carry me through all the years of my adulthood and gardens I created. After eight decades, I’ve come to recognize the garden as a metaphor for life — or maybe the other way around, come to think of it. All is not pretty flowers, nor neatly mowed lawns, healthy tomato plants and beautiful trees. Challenges happen every day. Plants die, weeds grow; dangers lurk in shadowy corners. Weeds are not always a bad thing, often necessary for a balanced life with all the bugs and critters that go with them. But there are bad weeds and destructive bugs, as with people — some of which need removed or controlled to keep our lives calmer, running smoothly and more pleasantly. It’s complex beyond our understanding. Nothing can prevent that (and we are not in charge, although we often would like to think so). It’s full of sheer delight and priceless treasures, though as often accompanied by unexpected tragedy and chaos, and sometimes we need to redesign and plant anew to bring back butterflies and hummingbirds. But even in winter when all looks lifeless and bleak at first glance, if we clean and adjust the glasses of our attitudes and go for a walk, we find evergreen trees, Christmas roses, holly berries, bluebirds and the magic of new life dormant but impatient to grow — all to give us hope. I’m starting my birthday celebration this morning with a stroll down our path, bundled up against the damp chill of this December, to see what gifts Mother Nature has bestowed to me and promises she’s made. Hellebores are already budded, fat and gleaming but still tightly furled, skirted by delicate woodsia ferns, violets and Jacob’s ladder. Tomorrow, I’ll go with pruners to cut fat branches of juniper frosted with blue berries, red rose hips and feathery miscanthus plumes to fill a Chinese garden pot I keep in the living room. I’ll hang a wreath on the door to tempt our Christmas elf out of hiding and suspend my hand-cut, three-dimensional snowflakes at the window to swirl and dance, wishfully tempting snow to fall and blanket the chaos of the winter garden with glistening, pristine white, at least for a day or two. Meanwhile, I’ll keep working the earth of the garden of my soul, adding fresh nutrients of knowledge, planting seeds of new understanding, pruning and shaping thoughts and ideals, decorating with flowers of learning, art and music, watering with tears of memories and warming it with the sunshine of love. But as I grow along with my garden, I find that the list of things I want grows smaller with each passing year. What I really need, money can’t buy; I take more pleasure in giving away things from my heart than in receiving. I’m looking forward to the coming decades, with a garden for each succeeding year. And lots more chocolate. As someone said recently, “If you’re lucky enough to get old, you should celebrate it. ” And I am — it’s a party from 11 a. m. to 4 p. m. Saturday in The Parrillel Universe Studio, 4001 Indiana Ave. in Joplin. There will be cake and y’all are invited. Come help me welcome in a new decade of wonderful things to come. \n",

      "The community will have an opportunity to tour Dover Hill Elementary School, 1100 N. Main St. , during an open house from 5 to 7 p. m. Tuesday, Jan. 3. District staff and Dover Hill parents and students will be able to tour the building during separate events. The school, Joplin’s newest, replaces Columbia and West Central elementary schools, which are close at 100 years old. Dover Hill was built on land donated by the city of Joplin and paid for by a $25 million bond issue that was approved by district voters in June 2020. The school will open for classes on Wednesday, Jan. 4. “We are so excited to be opening Dover Hill Elementary for the students, staff, parents and community,” Superintendent Kerry Sachetta said in a statement. “The new building will address the needs of our students and staff extremely well with the demands of education today. Dover Hill Elementary is another fine example of our community recognizing a need and coming together to support our students’ best interest. ”Students and staff at Columbia and West Central have already merged as one Dover Hill community, with grades K-2 at West Central and grades 3-5 at Columbia until the new building opens next month. “We are excited to enter our last phase of integration with the two schools,” Principal Bret Ingle said in a statement. “Last year we were able to start the collaboration process with staff, and this fall we have been able to bring the students together at two different campuses. Everyone is looking forward to finally being under one roof. ”The school was designed by CGA Architects and the DLR Group, with assistance from Allgeier Martin & Associates. Crossland Construction managed the project. “We are proud of Dover Hill in the way it captures a historic context with modern touches and how it sits on a prominent and unique location within our community,” said principal architect Chad Greer, referring to both the old schools and the Dover Hill property. “We are excited for the generations of kids that will experience this new school. ”The Joplin Board of Education’s total approved project cost was $27,079,351. 67. Current projections show final construction costs coming in under that budget. \n",

      "A grant will be sought to pay a portion of the cost to build a trail connector and Main Street underpass by the city of Joplin. The project would link the Landreth Park Trail to the Dover Parks Trail and also connect the eastern and western sides of Landreth Park. The Joplin City Council on Monday endorsed a staff proposal to apply for $500,000 toward the cost of the $1. 5 million project through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Finance Director Leslie Haase said it was determined that projects on the list for parks and stormwater sales tax spending were a good fit because the matching funds required for the grant can be provided by the money in the sales tax fund. There is $1 million in the sales tax fund committed to the project. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is accepting grant applications for eligible projects with a maximum award of up to $500,000, according to city officials. The grant requires at least a 50% match. A draft application had to be submitted by Wednesday of this week, with final submission due by Nov. 16. Other projects would not fit the criteria for the grant because the matching funds were not available or could not be ready in time to meet the grant filing deadline. According to the city’s calculation, this project would be a benefit to the future Dover Outdoor Recreation Area, which is to be a bike and trail park, as well as the new Dover Hill Elementary School, Ozark Christian College, downtown Joplin and the Joplin Regional Trails Coalition. The council also approved the purchase of two new firetrucks to replace a 10-year-old truck for Fire Station No. 4 at 3402 S. Main St. and an 11-year-old truck for Fire Station No. 6 at 5332 W. 32nd St. The fire department reports that there are significant mechanical issues with the existing trucks and parts are not available from the manufacturer whose plant has closed. The trucks would be purchased from MacQueen Emergency for $1,954,900. One would be paid for by the half-cent public safety sales tax fund and the other from the city’s general fund. Chief Gerald Ezell submitted the spending request for immediate approval, saying a price increase of $125,000 can be averted if the purchase order is issued by Oct. 31. In other business, the council approved an annual agreement with the Joplin Humane Society to provide animal sheltering services for animals brought to it by the city’s animal control staff and by residents of the city. The city has had this type of agreement with the shelter and animal control service since 1975, according to city documents. The contract provides for basic impoundment services for stray animals or animals collected for a violation of city code, and rabies quarantine services for animals involved in bite cases. The Humane Society asked for an 8. 3% inflation increase, which will amount to about $235,000 for the fiscal year beginning Nov. 1. There is a schedule of fees that can be charged to residents or the city for other services including rabies sample testing, daily animal care, animal intake and tracking, quarantine, euthanasia and cremation. The agreement also allows for other charges to the city when extraordinary care is required for an animal. It also allows for the Humane Society to receive 20% of the fines it collects, as specified in city code, for animals retrieved by the owner. The agreement can be renewed for four years with consent of both the city and Humane Society. \n",

      "Renovation of city-owned land around the intersection of Fourth Street and Murphy Boulevard is being planned by Joplin city administrators. It could be awhile before the construction is done, but design work is being contracted for landscaping and parking lot projects that will follow previous plans to replace the traffic signals at the intersection. Dan Johnson, the city’s public works director, said at a City Council meeting earlier this month that repairs of the rock wall at the northeast corner of the intersection leading into Landreth Park are needed. A large tree is damaging the structure. The wall was built in the 1930s by workers in a federal program created to provide relief to the joblessness caused by the Great Depression. Johnson sought and obtained council approval to amend a work authorization contract with Olsson, an engineering firm, for additional design work around the existing intersection at a cost of $58,300. The firm already holds a contract for engineering work to erect the new traffic signals there. “This is amendment to add some beautification efforts,” Johnson said. The plan calls for some landscaping along the wall and some type of flowering backdrop trees to be planted at a distance behind the wall. A new connection to the Landreth Park Trail would be built. Across the street on the southeast corner, a new parking lot and trailhead would be constructed and landscaped. On the southwest corner, street trees would be planted, and there would be some new landscaping on the northwest corner. The new signals were on the list of projects to be done with funding from the capital improvements sales tax, which voters approved in 2004. The council authorized that project in September 2020, according to city records. Landscaping and wall repair for the area are being done as part of the city’s action plans to improve community appearance. The action plans were developed to accomplish six goals set by the council in a recent strategic plan. During the council discussion of the contract amendment, Councilman Gary Shaw said Fourth Street in that area is busy with traffic. He asked if any street closures would be involved. Johnson said there would not be total closure of all the lanes but that there would be some closures of either east-west lanes or north-south lanes when the construction is being done. Council member Kate Spencer asked why the existing tree next to the rock wall has to be removed. Johnson said the tree’s root system is damaging the wall. “If you were starting from scratch and had professionals choosing where to plant that tree, they wouldn’t plant it there,” he said. “It hides the wall. The roots go way out past the drip line of the tree, and they are damaging that wall. ”Councilman Josh DeTar asked if a large tree on the northwest corner would be removed. Johnson said it and the other trees there would be cut down because the city’s sign shop has to repeatedly cut them back to keep branches off the street signs. The trees also are a safety issue because motorists cannot always see other traffic. The council voted to approve the work authorization amendment for engineering work of the beautification project. \n",

      "The Joplin Trails Coalition was recently awarded an AARP Community Challenge grant to construct a concrete ramp on a section of the Frisco Trail near Webb City to accommodate older individuals and those who are disabled. The group, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating and maintaining multiuse trails throughout Jasper County, was awarded the grant this summer. The $13,750 grant will provide funds to install an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant concrete ramp on the Frisco Greenway Trail, on the south side of Fountain Road, in Webb City. The ramp will not only make the trail access and road crossing safer, but it will allow improved accessibility for community members of all ages, especially those using mobility supports. AARP Missouri received a total of 53 applications this year. “AARP Missouri is committed to working with communities to improve residents’ quality of life through tangible changes,” State Director Craig Eichelman said in a statement. “We are proud to collaborate with this year’s grantees as they make immediate improvements in their communities to jumpstart long-term change, especially for Missourians 50 and over. ”Grantees are required to implement quick-action projects that help communities become more livable by improving public places; transportation; housing; diversity, equity and inclusion; digital access; and civic engagement, with an emphasis on the needs of adults age 50 and over. “AARP developed the Community Challenge grant program in response to mayors, local leaders and residents who recognized the importance of getting quick wins to help build momentum for more livable communities,” said Dan Domsic, AARP Missouri interim communications director. Bob Herbst, president of the coalition, said the ramp will be about 50 feet long. A retirement community is located near the section of the trail, which has a concrete sidewalk leading to it. “When I found out about the grant this year and what they were looking for, I thought about a specific section of the trail,” he said. “We’ve actually been talking about it for a while, but it’s the section south of Fountain Road. It has a slope, and we tried to put the fine gravel on top, but it keeps washing away. It leaves behind this rough, big gravel, which isn’t good for anybody, but especially for people who are in wheelchairs or walking with crutches. ”The project is set for completion by the end of November. Herbst said the nonprofit organization relies heavily on grants to support its mission and that they’re thankful for the support from AARP. “We try to use our financial resources wisely, and at the beginning of the year, we look at all of the things that need to be done,” he said. “We rank them in order of importance, so anytime we get a grant, it aids our efforts to make improvements on the trail or to expand the trail system. Grants are vital to what we’re trying to accomplish. ”AARP Community Challenge grant projects will be funded in all 50 states, Washington, D. C. , Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands. The grant program is part of AARP’s nationwide Livable Communities initiative. Since 2017, AARP Missouri has awarded 17 grants and $202,650 through the program to nonprofit organizations and government entities across the state. \n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo. — A public ceremony will be held Saturday at Mount Hope Cemetery in connection with the graves of the 1,100 veterans buried there being decorated via the Wreaths Across America program. The ceremony will be held at 11 a. m. Saturday at the verterans memorial, according to Travis Boyd, Mount Hope manager. A truck delivering the wreaths is to be unloaded at 10 a. m. , he said. The wreaths are provided by donations through the Wreaths Across America program. “We were shooting for donations for the 1,100 wreaths we needed, and we received exactly enough for 1,100,” Boyd said. Volunteers from the JROTC program at Webb City High School along with members of Joplin American Legion Post 13 and the Webb City American Legion Post 322, and some members of Veterans of Foreign Wars posts, will place the wreaths at the graves, Boyd said. Members of those organizations also made donations toward the cost of the wreaths. Boyd said that a cemetery volunteer, Susie Crutcher, worked to bring the wreath program to Mount Hope and to raise donations for the wreaths. Her father, the late Bruce Benson, was known as “Webb City’s Bugle Boy,” because he played taps every evening at the Webb City post office in honor of his country and his late wife. Wreaths Across America is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded to continue and expand the annual wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, which Maine businessman Morrill Worcester started in 1992. The mission of Wreaths Across America is to remember the fallen, honor those who serve and teach the value of freedom. Mount Hope Cemetery is located at 3700 N. Range Line Road in Webb City. \n",

F St. , for the last time and return to school in 2023 at the new Dover Hill Elementary School. Because of early 20th century mining in the area, the century-old school building will have to be torn down. The question then becomes what happens to the large lot that the school sits on?Residents of the North Heights and Roanoke neighborhoods gathered at the home of resident Kate DeTar on Wednesday, across Sergeant Avenue from the school, to discuss that question and figure out how they can have a say in the future of the Columbia school property. Shaun Grindle, vice president of the North Heights Neighborhood Group, led an informational meeting to determine whether residents are interested in creating a Neighborhood Improvement District and working to acquire the property from the Joplin School District, maintaining it as a community space. About 27 people attended and seven people agreed to join a new subcommittee of the North Heights Neighborhood Group, called the Columbia Oversight Committee to decide whether creating the NID is feasible and how to sell the idea to their neighbors. “This was the best case scenario to happen,” Grindle said. “In my mind, I was thinking if we could have 20 people there and if we could walk away with at least five committee members that would be a huge success. and we surpassed both those hopes, so to me this was like, wow, amazing. People actually recognize this matters and they are showing up because it matters. ”Grindle said the NID, if created by residents of the neighborhood in an election, could vote to impose a small property tax assessment on the properties within the neighborhood, then use the proceeds to borrow money to either buy the property or improve it if the school district chooses to transfer the property at little or no cost. Grindle told the gathering that he and DeTar had spoken with school district officials on Tuesday about the district’s plans for the lot and came away encouraged that the district wanted to work with the neighborhood to keep the property a public space. School Superintendent Kerry Sachetta said in a phone interview on Wednesday that the district is in no hurry to dispose of either the Columbia school property or the West Central school property on West Seventh Street, which will also close when Dover Hill opens in 2023. He said structural problems created by mine shafts under the brick school and a concrete tornado safe room built about five years ago mean the structures will have to be torn down. After that, Sachetta said, the district plans to seed the land with grass and mow it, but is in no hurry to sell the property. “We don’t want to have a piece of property that’s becoming dilapidated and not being used to be a problem for the neighborhood,” Sachetta said. “We will raze the buildings, then we can do what we want with the property. If we wanted to sell it, we could sell it; if we want to hang on to it for a while and make decisions later, we could do that. ”He said the three options available to the Joplin Board of Education are to offer the property for sale either by a real estate broker or by sealed bids, or they could transfer it to a taxing entity, such as a Neighborhood Improvement District, for transfer. “The school district, if the board elected to, could just sit on the property for a while to see if anything materializes,” Sachetta said. “Right now — until some other decision is made, the school district could elect to just mow the grass for now. ”Grindle said Wednesday’s meeting was strictly informational and was just the start of a long process that he hoped would lead to the neighborhood creating a common space that can benefit everyone in the area. Timothy Beck, a North Heights resident who volunteered to help the Columbia school committee, said he felt good about the meeting. “I thought it was a very productive meeting,” Beck said. “We had a lot of community involvement in this meeting, a great turnout, it was very informative. I think members of the neighborhood are going to be able to leave tonight being able to make an informed decision. ”\n",

      "Christmas came early for Joplin teaching staff members who had the opportunity to tour the new Dover Hill Elementary School during an open house on Friday ahead of its official opening early next year. Dover Hill Elementary, located at 1100 N. Main St. , will house about 400 students from Columbia and West Central, two Joplin elementary schools that are nearly a century old. The estimated 70,000-square-foot school was built to accommodate up to 450 students. Ground was broken in April 2021 at the Dover Hill site. It was built on land donated by the city of Joplin and with proceeds from a $25 million bond issue approved by voters in 2020. The staff open house was held on Friday afternoon for teachers to see the modern architecture, bright colors and overall design of the new building. Classrooms will be open to students starting Wednesday, Jan. 4. “We are so excited to be opening Dover Hill Elementary for the students, staff, parents and community,” Superintendent Kerry Sachetta said in a statement. “The new building will address the needs of our students and staff extremely well with the demands of education today. Dover Hill Elementary is another fine example of our community recognizing a need and coming together to support our students’ best interest. ”Kindergarten through second grade will be located downstairs and the remaining grades, third through fifth, in the upper level. The playground and outdoor area is accessible from the kindergarten classroom. Other grade levels have collaboration spaces that open up to other classrooms. “Each one of these rooms can be divided or opened up,” said Chad Greer, principal architect at Corner Greer & Associates. “It really becomes this interesting pod of students that can mix and do collaborative things together. ”The front entrance feeds into the media center that contains a mural that pays homage to Joplin and its history. Jennifer Glenn, fifth grade teacher at Cecil Floyd Elementary, described the school as beautiful, open and inviting. She said the students’ faces are going to light up when they enter the doors. “I think they’ll feel safe, welcome and happy to walk through the halls every day,” she said. “Hopefully, it will help spark their love of learning. ”Special education teachers will have the opportunity to move into the new school in August, the beginning of the next school year. Jana Bates, a communication behavior social skills teacher at Irving Elementary, viewed the new school and said she thinks the students will feel like kids in a candy store on their first day. “You just want to take it all in and see every classroom,” said Bates. “I think the kids are going to run up and down the hallways and look out every window. ”The special education suite features individual restrooms, technology and classrooms that double as safe rooms. All the windows in the building can withstand wind speeds up to 200 mph. “In the classrooms, there are Clevertouch TVs, which are basically like big iPads,” said Bates. “They’re touch screen TVs that interface with our computers. My classroom would definitely benefit from the space and the collaboration. I think it’s going to show better peer interaction. ”There will be two entrances to Dover Hill Elementary — staff and buses will enter through the entrance off North Main Street and parents will use the Murphy Boulevard entrance. Greer said the parent entrance can hold up to 250 cars to keep traffic from being congested on Murphy. The building was designed by CGA Architects and the DLR Group, with assistance from Allgeier Martin & Associates. Crossland Construction managed the project. Open house toursParents and students attending Dover Hill can tour the school from 5 to 6 p. m. on Monday, Jan. 2. A community open house will be held from 5 to 7 p. m. Tuesday, Jan. 3. \n",

      "PINEVILLE, Mo. — An 18-year-old Southwest City man was ordered to stand trial this week on a charge that he cut his girlfriend with a knife. Associate Judge John LePage ruled at the conclusion of a preliminary hearing Wednesday in McDonald County Circuit Court that Alexis Sancez-Estrada should be tried on counts of domestic assault in the first degree and possession of a controlled substance. The defendant's initial appearance in a trial division will be Dec. 22. Sancez-Estrada was arrested on the charges following a disturbance and reported stabbing Oct. 3 at his residence on Springs Road near Southwest City. A deputy who responded to the scene learned that there had been a domestic dispute between the defendant and his girlfriend, Nicole Estrada, resulting in her being taken to Freeman Neosho Hospital for treatment of a cut to her shoulder. She later told the deputy that Sancez-Estrada had come home from work and began examining her phone. She said she told him to stop and he cut her with a knife. \n",

      "A 20-year-old defendant took a plea offer this week in a Joplin street robbery case that could lead to a suspended imposition of sentence. Caleb B. Carvin, of Duquesne, changed his plea to guilty Thursday in Jasper County Circuit Court on counts of second-degree robbery and leaving the scene of an vehicle crash. In exchange for the plea, the state has promised to recommend that Carvin be granted a suspended imposition of sentence. Second-degree robbery carries a possible punishment range of five to 15 years. Judge Dean Dankelson delayed formal acceptance or rejection of the plea bargain and ordered the completion of a sentencing assessment of the defendant prior to a sentencing hearing Feb. 27. According to court documents, Carvin arranged to meet Esmahely Rodas on Dec. 1, 2021, in the 3500 block of North Range Line Road concerning an iPhone 11 that Rodas had for sale on Facebook Marketplace. Carvin asked to see the phone and then tried to drive off with it without paying Rodas. Rodas held on to Carvin’s car door long enough to wrest the phone away from him. But Carvin and an unknown man in his company came back and pulled Rodas from his vehicle, assaulted him and tried to leave a second time. But, as they were leaving, Rodas managed to pull the temporary license tag from their vehicle to give police, prompting their return to the scene yet again to take the tag back from him. This time as he got out of his car, however, Carvin failed to put the vehicle in park and it rolled forward and struck a woman’s Chevrolet Camaro, causing an estimated $3,000 worth of damage. Carvin and his companion did finally manage to flee the scene, but he was eventually identified and arrested two weeks later. Rodas suffered a black eye, swollen cheek and various cuts and abrasions, according to a probable-cause affidavit. \n",

      "Approval of a resolution to accept a $5 million grant awarded to the city of Joplin by state legislators will be sought Monday from the Joplin City Council. The grant is to be used on utility line needs. It requires a 50% match, which would bring the total to $10 million for the project. The terms require that the money be used on water or sewer lines, stormwater drainage or lead service lines. The grant allows for replacement, repair, updates or extensions of any of those infrastructure systems, according to city reports. The grant forms must be filed by Dec. 31. City staff members have been working with the Department of Natural Resources to identify the appropriate projects for the state grant from its share of funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. Through matching programs like this one, city officials hope to complete up to $57 million in various projects throughout the city. The council also will be asked to approve portable and mobile police radios from Motorola Solutions at a cost of $394,795. 83. The ordinance is placed on the agenda for emergency adoption to become effective immediately because the expense was planned and included in the city budget, which the council previously approved, and will not require a second reading. City staff will seek authorization of the council to pass on $17,000 from a federal Community Development Block Grant to the Homeless Coalition. The money is an annual allocation to pay for licensing for a computer software program and other costs involved in using the system to keep records of displaced or homeless people. In addition, approval is sought to pass on $50,000 in annual CDBG funding to the Economic Security Corp. to pay personnel and office expenses to operate the Coordinated Entry Program for providing assistance to those in need. The Coordinated Entry Program is regarded as a necessary tool to address the issue of homelessness and meet the needs of the homeless, according to city information. The program is the point of contact for local organizations to assess the needs of people in need and homeless applicants and to advance them from temporary to permanent housing. An agreement to provide the funds to the ESC also allows that organization to operate the program. A construction agreement for some remodeling work on the first floor of City Hall is proposed. The contract would be for $78,557 with Joplin Industrial Electric Inc.  The remodeling project would be done to relocate the staff of the neighborhood services department for work on a city action plan to address declining neighborhoods. That staff is to be moved from an upper floor to the first floor, and more positions will be added to the department. The work to be done is part of the city's effort to address concerns of residents expressed in the city manager's listening tour and one of six goals set by the City Council to make city improvements. The added staff will be paid from money generated by the voter-approved use tax. City staff prepared construction drawings for the project, and the city took bids. There were two bids, with Joplin Industrial Electric's bid the lower of the two. The other bid was from American Construction Inc. at $79,781. Also on the agenda for approval:• Demolition of a house at $2,759 by B&D Yardbuilders. • Sales of lots declared as excess property to Habitat for Humanity, including 1513 E. Hill St. for $3,927; 909 Langston Hughes-Broadway for $9,727; and 304 N. Cox for $6,007. \n",

      "The public will have the opportunity to tour two new buildings next week during open houses for Dover Hill Elementary School and the Jasper County courthouse in Joplin. An open house for Dover Hill, 1100 N. Main St. , will be held from 5 to 7 p. m. Tuesday. The school will open for classes on Wednesday and house 450 students who previously attended Columbia and West Central elementary schools. The school, built on land donated by the city of Joplin, was constructed via a $25 million bond issue approved by voters in 2020. Current projections show final construction costs coming in under the approximately $27 million budget set by the Joplin School Board. The building was designed by CGA Architects and the DLR Group, with assistance from Allgeier Martin & Associates. Crossland Construction managed the project. An open house for the new Jasper County courts building in Joplin, 633 S. Pearl Ave. , will begin at 10 a. m. Friday, Jan. 6. It is expected to fully open for business beginning Monday, Jan. 9. Voters in 2019 approved the renewal of a quarter-cent increase in the county sales tax to pay for nearly $50 million in projects. The new Joplin courts building, at a cost of about $35 million, is being paid through that initiative. It is intended to replace the nearby courts building that was built in the 1970s and is now too small to handle the court cases and other business that passes through it. Other projects funded by the sales tax increase were a renovation of the Carthage courthouse and an expansion of the Jasper County Jail, both of which were completed in 2021. Demolition of the old courts building in Joplin could take place in the first part of 2023, Jasper County commissioners said. \n",

      "Let’s end the year on a positive note, we said Thursday, promising a look at 10 reasons to be optimistic about Joplin, about where we are and where we are going in the coming year. We looked at five on Thursday. Here are five more. 1. Missouri Southern State University is raising money for a $30-million health education building, proposed for construction from late 2023 to early 2025, that will emphasize Southern’s commitment to health education and health science. The proposed Health Science Innovation Center could also drastically change the look of the campus, with renderings showing a large building featuring Southern’s traditional brick front with white columns occupying a dominant spot front and center of the campus oval. 2. Joplin has a robust, dedicated social services community, and many of the organizations are expanding in order to meet the demand. Jasper County CASA is almost finished with its Training and Connection Center, 1825 Carolyn Place. It will allow advocates and children to meet regularly and build relationships in a safe, stable setting and serve as the organization’s first home to call its own. The indefatigable Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity recently completed its first multifamily housing unit, a duplex at 1405-1407 E. Sixth St. in Joplin. And Joplin-based Rapha International recently kicked off a campaign to increase the size and capacity of its Hope and Healing Center. The group has for 20 years been serving survivors of trafficking, exploitation and abuse. Those three are just the tip of the iceberg. 3. The elections of 2022 — and the relatively high voter turnout that accompanied them — showed that area residents are civic-minded and engaged in their community and country. In Jasper County, November’s general election produced a 42. 67% voter turnout — the third-highest in the county’s history, following the 2020 presidential election and the November 2018 election. Newton County saw a voter turnout rate of 46. 84%, and nearly 50% of registered voters in Ottawa County in Northeast Oklahoma showed up to the polls in November. These are solid numbers, much higher than some elections, which only attract a percentage of voters in the single digits. It’s great to see residents here exercising their right to vote and making their voices heard. 4. Children and teenagers in the Joplin area continue to amaze us with their intelligence, athleticism, volunteer efforts and love of community. In 2022, we spotlighted young people like sisters Alizeh and Sania Hammad, seniors at Thomas Jefferson Independent Day School who developed a free food pantry for the Islamic Society of Joplin, and 8-year-old Annabella Keith, a Southwest City girl who raised nearly $700 for the Ronald McDonald House through a bake sale. But there are thousands more young people in this area who are doing great things every day: winning sports championships, earning scholarships, competing in events such as National History Day, performing community service, getting good grades, helping people around them and learning everything they can in school. 5. KCU-Joplin College of Dental Medicine is slated to open this summer and will welcome its first class, making Joplin perhaps the only community that has seen a medical and dental school open in the community. All of this adds up to a pretty good place to be as 2023 gets ready to kick off, and we can’t help but think we’ve only scratched the surface. Coming Saturday: The work is never done, and with that in mind we’ll look at some of the priorities we hope the community can address in the new year to keep the momentum rolling. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Members of the Casa de Sanidad church will gather Saturday at Memorial Hall for their annual end-of-the-year celebration. They will share a meal; people will write and perform plays. At a certain point, they will write out wishes for themselves and the church, pray for the wishes and then destroy them. It’s a way to encourage people for the next year. “At the end of the year, we can be together and dream of the future,” Pastor Francisco Bonilla said. “We don’t live by the past, we learn from the past, but we live towards a better future. ”It’s been a hard year for Casa de Sanidad, one of the oldest Hispanic churches in Carthage. A fire destroyed their building at Second and Grant streets in late October. The building and everything in it — chairs, audio/video equipment, musical instruments and more — were a total loss. Now the church is taking this moment to look forward to rebuilding. The church is registered as Iglesia Cristiana Hispanoamericana, but through the years became known as Casa de Sanidad, which means “healthy household. ” It currently has a membership of about 350 people. Bonilla was brought to Carthage by David Lang, pastor at Fairview Christian Church, looking to reach the growing Hispanic population in the area. After joining Fairview in late 1996, Bonilla started out by knocking on doors, inviting Hispanic people to come to church. Casa de Sanidad began to grow, going from 30 people to over 100. Soon, they faced the challenge of uniting a diverse mix of denominations in the Hispanic community under one church roof. Members came from many different backgrounds to Carthage, and Bonilla had to balance his message to reach everyone. This eventually led to splits in the church. After a couple of years, Bonilla started to look for a building of their own. By 1999, the church split from Fairview to establish its own identity and own building. They bought the old Salvation Army on Grant Street, a small building that held about 75 people. Over the years, Casa de Sanidad kept moving buildings for the growing church, reaching a peak membership of 800. The church also owns a low-power radio station, which was useful for broadcasting news about the COVID-19 pandemic to Carthage’s Hispanic population. While the splits reduced membership, every parting led to a new church. Casa de Sanidad became the root in the large tree of Hispanic churches in Carthage. “People have said we are the place where the churches have started to grow in Carthage,” Bonilla said. “They do not belong to us in a legal way, but we’ve been at the center. ”Destructive fireOn the night of Oct. 22, dangerously high winds threatened Southwest Missouri. A fire started in a vacant building next to the church, and leftover construction material on the lot helped fuel the fire. The Carthage Fire Department arrived quickly, but there was little they could do to save the building, Bonilla said. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Bonilla lives in an apartment across the street from the church and remembers a knock on his door that night. He woke up but nobody was at the door. He could see the fire starting at the corner of the block. Someone screamed the fire was going to spread to the church, but Bonilla didn’t know what to do. “I walked over to where the fire was, and the heat was so intense,” Bonilla said. “I don’t know how the firefighters stayed so close to that heat. It was so heavy, it wasn’t easy to be close. ”He moved to a corner of the block, and 10 minutes later, the corner of the church building started to smoke. Bonilla said he knew nobody could stop that, and remembers entering a state of shock. Instead of attempting to salvage items from the church, he returned to his apartment and watched as it burned. “So, I came back and sat down here,” Bonilla said. “My mind was just blank, realizing that I could not do anything. ”The Sunday following the fire, members of Casa de Sanidad met at an event center across the street from the smoldering remains of the church. Bonilla wasn’t sure how many would show up, but the congregation was packed in. Working from their previous relationship, members of Fairview have now offered their building to meet on Sunday mornings. Bonilla said it’s been good to still gather as a church, and worship attendance has been steady. There have been several offers on the property, but the third week after the fire, the church decided to rebuild. They know that the cost will be high. Bonilla pulls up a calculator on his phone and types in familiar numbers. He estimates a rebuilding cost of $200 per square foot, which works out to about $2. 7 million. “We will understand what happened to us, it happened with the purpose to rebuild a better building. We are focusing on doing that,” Bonilla said. Looking to 2023, beyondWith excitement, Bonilla talks about his plans for the new Casa de Sanidad building. Taking inspiration from the Drake Hotel Apartments, a place in Carthage for elderly people to live at a low cost, Bonilla’s vision is to build apartments on the first floor of the church for an older Hispanic population. “My people will need a place to live when they get older,” Bonilla said. “They will have no place to live. I want to build as many apartments as I can, in order to help the Hispanic people that will not have a check. Everyone is dreaming of how this can be. ”On top of the new building would be the church, with space to expand for a potential community room on the ground floor. Casa de Sanidad members have many ideas on how to raise the money needed for a new church. After establishing a rebuilding committee, the church is confident, Bonilla said. They’re willing to sell tamales and pupusas, hold raffles, sell church property and cars — whatever needs to be done. “I have a lot of faith, we will get the money,” Bonilla said. “I don’t know where, but the money is there somewhere. ”Bonilla’s faith is the foundation for this dream, believing everything that happens to those who love God will turn to good. On his phone, he has a photo of a handwritten Bible passage, Philippians 1:12. Members of Casa de Sanidad have memorized this verse, and recite it during worship: “Quiero que sepan, hermanos, que todo lo que nos ha sucedido es más bien, para el progreso del evangelio,”In English, it translates to: “I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel. ”\n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Fire early Saturday night destroyed three buildings near the corner of Grant Street and Central Avenue near the square in Carthage. The blaze started shortly before 8 p. m. and quickly consumed a former lumber company building between the Henson Metal Building Supply business and the Hispanic Christian Church at 135 S. Grant St. By 8:05 p. m. Saturday, wind and the intense heat had spread the fire to the church and the metal building supply company structure. Firefighters from Carthage, Webb City, Jasper and other departments were pouring water from three ladder trucks and other hose trucks as late as 9:20 p. m. , but flames were still visible above the roof line. Jasper County’s annex at the corner of Central and Howard was unaffected by the fire, according to County Clerk Charlie Davis. Fire officials were unavailable for comment as to whether any injuries were reported. The blaze had attracted hundreds of onlookers as late as 9:30 p. m. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Carthage’s first Hispanic church, founded in 1996, is looking to move on and rebuild after a Saturday night fire destroyed its home and two other downtown buildings. More than 100 members of Iglesia Cristiana Hispanoamericana, also known as Casa de Sanidad, met in The Plaza Events Center, 137 S. Grant St. , in one of two buildings the church owns across the street from the scene of the fire, to worship and declare their plans to remain united and build a new future. “I guess the mood right now is just to rebuild,” church member James Estrada said Sunday. “The past is obviously burned out, so we need to look to the future. I guess now is the future, we push toward the future and rebuilding, so I guess that’s something we look forward to. Everybody was sad to see it go, so many memories. At the same time, we’ve got to move on; we can’t be dwelling on the past for a long time. ”Carthage fire Chief Ryan Huntley said every firefighter in Carthage as well as firefighters and units from Webb City, Avilla, Jasper, Carterville and Duenweg responded to the fire that started in a storage shed at the former Krtek Lumber building, 100 S. Grant, just before 8 p. m. Saturday. Huntley said the first alarm came in at 7:52 p. m. and that firefighters arrived two minutes later to find the building in flames. Huntley said he believed the buildings were storage and were not being used for any business at the time of the fire. “The reports that we’ve got from our first guys that showed up with an engine is that that building that we are referring to as the old Krtek building was completely involved,” Huntley said. “At that point, we had embers being thrown north. We had the gas station across Central Avenue which was becoming an issue and the liquor store that they were concerned about. Then obviously the church was a major concern. ”Huntley said firefighters evacuated the Pete’s convenience store across Central from the Krtek building as well as the Wagon Liquor store just to the west. Other buildings around the fire were evacuated as well, including a bed-and-breakfast across the street and south of the scene. Huntley said the storage building burned extremely fast and hot, and had already started burning both the Krtek building offices to the north and the northeast corner of the church. “We tried to get in there to put water on it, but I think they were just a little bit late getting water on the church,” Huntley said. “The fire had probably already spread somewhere on the roof. We did shut down Pete’s convenience store for some time just to make sure we were keeping that under control. . . . The wind was not our friend by any means, but I am thankful it was blowing from the south and it wasn’t blowing more toward the west going across Grant. ”The storage building had burned to the ground in less than half an hour and the east side of the Krtek offices were burning as well. Firefighters focused on keeping the cloud of swirling embers from damaging homes to the north across Central. “A cardboard bin at the liquor store across Central caught fire, and we put that out quickly,” Huntley said. “Then we had a tree catch fire in the yard of a residence on north. Everything else was contained in that block. There may have been a broken window at the Health Department and a broken window from the heat at Midwest Agriculture. We had three ladder trucks pouring water on the church, but we couldn’t save it. ”Huntley said it was a miracle that no one was injured battling the flames. A crowd of people gathered on three sides of the fire watching the scene. “We had so many people on scene and so many people moving and doing stuff, I am very, very happy that we did not have anyone hurt,” he said. “We don’t even have any minor injuries; so ecstatic about that. ”He said state fire inspectors were in town early Sunday morning to investigate, but finding a cause in the debris would be nearly impossible because of the level of destruction. Pastor Francisco Bonilla, who helped found Iglesia Cristiana Hispanoamericana 26 years ago, said he bought the former garage and car dealership at at 122 S. Grant in the year 2001 and remodeled it and moved in that year. The church started in 1996 as a ministry of the Fairview Christian Church before striking off on its own. “Legally, the name is Iglesia Cristiana Hispanoamericana, or Hispanic Christian Church,” Bonilla said. “We are also known as Casa de Sanidad. So in the year 2010, we decided to change slowly to the name Casa de Sanidad, which means ‘healthy household. ’ I bought the building in 2001, and then we moved into it. I think that building was on fire once in the past, but we remodeled it and changed it to the way it was. It was a garage, they changed oil and repaired cars, and they sold cars there too. ”Bonilla said the church has about 350 registered members and about 200 who attend church regularly. He said he and the church’s leadership are brainstorming how to rebuild after Saturday’s fire. He said the church could attempt to acquire the former Krtek lot and rebuild on that entire city block. Bonilla said he plans to consult with the city and Jasper County, which owns the Annex building immediately to the east of the lot to see what plans are for it. Bonilla said he retired as church pastor three years ago, but the church hasn’t found a new pastor, so he continues to serve. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Cleanup in the aftermath of Saturday’s devastating fire that destroyed an old lumberyard and the first Hispanic church in Carthage started even as firefighters were checking on hot spots as city officials moved to remove what could have been an unsightly and dangerous rubble pile if it were to have sat in place for weeks. Carthage fire Chief Ryan Huntley said Carthage Street Department crews came in early Sunday morning, less than four hours after the fire had been put out, to knock down the brick walls of the Iglesia Cristiana Hispanoamericana church at 122 Grant St. that remained standing but were unstable because of the heat from the massive fire. Zeb Carney, the public works director, and Huntley consulted with City Administrator Greg Dagnan and decided to hire Bennett Construction Inc. , of Lamar, which happened to be in town working on repairing concrete ditches in another part of Carthage, to remove all the debris. “We were able to contact the owners, the pastor of the church and the owner of the old Krtek building, and they both acknowledged that it would take them awhile to get someone out there to clean it up, and you’d just have a dangerous pile of rubble sitting there,” Dagnan said. “So we went ahead and hired Bennett Construction on an emergency basis to haul off all the metal and all the debris that’s there so that it will be safe for our citizens. As a city, we’ll worry about getting compensated later. If there’s an insurance company that pays us, great. If not, it was just really best for our citizens that we make that area safe. ”Carney told the Carthage City Council at its regular meeting Tuesday that Bennett Construction has experience working with Carthage to clean up after major fires. On June 1, 2013, fire destroyed the historic two-story building at 146 E. Fourth St. , in the southeast corner of the square. At that time, the building, constructed in the 1880s, housed the Sassy Spoon restaurant and residences on the second floor. The city called Bennett Construction. “They had staff down here on Sunday within 45 minutes, and they had an excavator on site in another 30 minutes and pushed the walls in,” Carney said. “Not knowing if the business owners or the building owners had insurance, they took a risk and came down and helped us out on that. ”Carney said getting the lot cleared now is cheaper than putting a chain-link security fence around the whole block and waiting for the owners to find the money and to work to clear it. “We had 50 mph gusty winds on Sunday, so all the sheet metal that was in the interior of the old lumberyard, because they made metal roofing years ago, and the metal from the building itself, was blowing onto Highway 96 (Central Avenue),” Carney said. “We (the street department) spent about eight or nine hours out there on Sunday. We had a lot of street department guys who gave up part of their Saturday night and Sunday to be there to help us. “We made the determination due to the amount of foot traffic and pedestrians entering into the caution tape area that just from a public safety standpoint we’d go ahead and start the cleanup on it. So we contacted both property owners and started that cleanup Monday. If you guys drive by now, the old lumberyard is just about gone. ”Matt Hanna, a foreman for Bennett Construction on the cleanup job, said the lot will definitely be cleared by the end of the week, if not earlier. He said the metal scrap is being separated from other debris and will be sent for recycling. The bricks, wood and other burned wreckage was being loaded into 30-cubic-yard trash containers lined up on Grant Street and being hauled to the landfill in Lamar. “This isn’t a big job for us,” Hanna said. “Normally we don’t do a whole lot of this. We do a lot of sewer and concrete work, but Zeb knew he could make a call to us and we’d be able to get up here and help him. We already had the machines here, and so it wasn’t hard. ”Hanna’s crew also put out lines of “sock filters” on the sidewalks on the north and east side of the site to filter the rainwater that was flowing off the rubble pile and prevent ash and other debris from getting into the stormwater system. Council members at Tuesday’s meeting commended the Carthage Fire Department and firefighters from other communities that provided mutual aid for containing the fire to the buildings that were already burning and stopping it from spreading to homes and businesses on the north side of Central Avenue. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — The city will receive state money to help replace one of a number of closed or aging bridges in the next couple of years. The bridge on McGregor Street passing over the Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad tracks north of Central Avenue near Claxton Street was closed in February 2019 after it failed a state inspection. The Carthage City Council in December gave final approval to an agreement with the Missouri Department of Transportation that would accept state Off-System Bridge Program money to pay to replace that bridge. City Administrator Greg Dagnan said the total estimated cost to replace the bridge is $1,709,998. The city would be responsible for $205,200, as it’s part of the matching grant to pay for the bridge. The website bridgehunter. com says the McGregor Street bridge was built in 1950 and is a wooden bridge that carried about 800 vehicles a day in the last traffic survey done in 2017. A timeline in the documents approved by the City Council in December calls for plans to be drawn up and right-of-way to be acquired in 2023 and construction to begin sometime in the fall of 2024. Dagnan said that street could become essential if the city isn’t able to replace the three aging North Garrison Street bridges before one of them fails a state inspection, forcing the closure of that road. “One of the biggest conversations that our council has had and continues to have is the North Garrison Street bridges, (to) try to find grant money for them and get them repaired or replaced,” Dagnan said. “If for some reason we cannot get those bridges repaired, that McGregor Street bridge is going to be a vital thoroughfare. “We want it repaired for those folks who live in that neighborhood. We want it repaired for their benefit and convenience, but it also potentially could become a vital thoroughfare on that side of town, so we definitely need that bridge repaired. ”The three North Garrison Street bridges were built in the 1930s when North Garrison Street become U. S. Highway 71 and became the main route into and out of Carthage from the north. If those bridges are closed before the McGregor Street bridge is replaced, that would leave residents who live in the neighborhood on High Street north of the bridge having to go west to North Francis Street as the only way in and out of their neighborhood. That route also crosses over a 1930s-era bridge that has been rated in fair condition in recent bridge inspections. Dagnan said Carthage has several bridges that need to be replaced or repaired, and the McGregor Street bridge was one they could tackle now. “We have some bridges that are tied up in the railroad lawsuit,” Dagnan said. “Obviously our hands are tied on those until the court makes a ruling. ”Four bridges in Carthage that cross railroad tracks at Sycamore, Walnut, Oak and High streets are part of a federal lawsuit filed by the city of Carthage in 2019 claiming that Union Pacific Railroad, which owns the tracks in Carthage used by the Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, was responsible for maintaining the bridges, and not the city. Two of those bridges, the Sycamore and Walnut street bridges, were closed in 2015 and 2019, respectively, when they failed inspections, and the historic Oak Street bridge, a Route 66 original, is limited to vehicles of less than five tons. A pedestrian walkway on the bridge was closed a few years back when the supports to the walkway failed inspection. The federal court ruled in May that the city had cause for action, but it had waited too long to file suit against Union Pacific Railroad and the statute of limitations had expired. The city is appealing that ruling. \n",

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — The Neosho School District hopes to open its own childcare and development facility for the children of staff members. “This is my fifth year here and from day one we have ascertained from meetings with staff or exit interviews with staff that challenges in finding childcare sometimes played a part in the decision” to leave or stay in a job, Superintendent Jim Cummins said. “In at least two instances, one staff member drives to McDonald County for childcare and the other drives to Carthage and back. This will help them, and it will save the district money by avoiding new staff trainings when we lose staff due to childcare issues. \"Cummins said he drew inspiration from his time in the Carl Junction School District, which has a childcare option for staff, and approached the school board with the idea. Board members liked the idea, and district officials began looking for a location for a childcare center. About six months ago, a board member discovered that the High Street Christian Church building was on the market. Board members and school staff toured the structure to determine if it would be large enough to hold the number of anticipated children and what updates it would need to be approved for childcare. “The price was right but there were two caveats: time to determine what repairs would be needed and what type of zoning would be required to go from a church to a daycare,” Cummins said. The city’s Zoning and Planning Committee denied a recommendation for rezoning the property from R-1 to R-3, a change that would also allow for multi-family housing. The primary concern for neighbors, committee members said, was what would happen to the property if the school chose to sell it after it had been rezoned to R-3 specifically for a daycare but also with allowances for a multi-family housing structure. Instead, the city suggested a special-use permit that typically held a three-year approval period. “My comment to the city at that point in time was, ‘That is a pretty big investment just for three years of knowing that we will be OK to operate as a daycare,’” Cummins said. “Well, they ended up putting in a special-use permit for 10 years, which satisfied the school board. ”The 10-year special-use permit was approved by the Neosho City Council. The city will complete a traffic safety study and make suggestions on the current single-entry point to a possible circle drive to help with flow in and out during peak hours of operation between 6:30 a. m. and 5 p. m. Next stepsThe school district closed on the property on Dec. 15. Remodeling of the building will begin soon to transform it into a childcare facility that is anticipated to see 30 to 60 children if past survey numbers hold true. Once school is back in session after the holiday break, the district will advertise for the director’s position for the childcare facility. Ongoing discussions with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will help with securing funding for the facility and also for the licensing process to move forward. Meals for the facility will likely come from one of the district’s existing prep locations, the superintendent said. The district also hopes to survey local daycares about their rates and what ages of children they take. “We have no intention of competing with existing childcare providers but rather supplement them by providing childcare for our staff only initially,” Cummins said. Once the actual number of children to be served is determined, then the number of staff and district support for the childcare facility will be established, he said. “We know we may need to support it at some level,” Cummins said. “At the end of the day, if we have to put $25,000 in addition to the revenue it generates, we will consider that a win if we can retain a handful of staff each year. ”The facility could begin enrollment in August. “I might add, too, there is value in a teacher or staff member knowing that they can run over midday to check on their child,” Cummins said. “There is comfort in knowing that they are right here in the district and know who is taking care of their child. ”\n",

      "A 24-year-old Carl Junction man will be sentenced next month in connection with a gun-pointing incident outside a restaurant in Airport Drive. Cameron M. Campbell pleaded guilty Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court to a charge of unlawful possession of a firearm in an agreement dismissing a related count of unlawful use of a weapon. The defendant was charged after an incident April 2 at a restaurant in the 5800 block of North Main Street Road in Airport Drive.

      "Thinking back on the experience, I am a little embarrassed about it. But this is what happened. I made my first visit last week to the Cornell Complex at Seventh Street and Joplin Avenue. Having watched this unique structure emerge from the ground up, I really wanted to see how the space inside was to be used to advance the visual and performing arts. I also wanted to see the Thomas Hart Benton exhibit and the membership show in the second-floor galleries. This is the embarrassing part. I must have said “wow” more than a hundred times. I couldn’t help myself. In the Benton exhibit, there are 91 master prints dating from 1929 to 1974. I said “wow” with virtually every one of them. Then there is the associated copy that helps put the image into context. Again, all I could say was “wow,” especially when Benton’s own words were used to describe the image. I have always been a fan of Benton — not because he is from Neosho, or that he once worked at a Joplin newspaper or that his last mural resides in Joplin’s City Hall. It is the captured motion of his style and his subject matter that intrigues me. He imagined art from a different perspective in that common scenes and characters from American life — literally right here in our backyard — could provide the basis for incredible and universally understood images. He practiced the concept that every picture tells a story. His images tell the stories of who we are and from where we came. I have long held the opinion that he is among this country’s greatest artists. I have visited Benton’s home and studio in Kansas City, and I have seen his work at the Nelson, the state Capitol, Crystal Bridges and elsewhere, but I have never seen a Benton exhibit like this one. This exhibit, presented by Virginia Laas and the Joplin Visitors and Convention Bureau, and organized by the State Historical Society of Missouri, will continue through March 4. This is the first time all of these lithographs have been displayed together. Kudos to all involved. The membership show, which showcases the work in several mediums of emerging and established local artists through Dec. 31, served as the perfect counterpoint to the Benton exhibit. As for the Cornell Complex, you have got to see it to grasp its full potential. It’s going to have an enormous impact. Hours are from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. Tuesday through Saturday. Off the pathI normally cover things on Main Street and Range Line Road, but every once in a while I venture off the beaten path. I was encouraged to try Trackside Burgers & BBQ at 1515 W. 10th St. This is the site of the former Fortune East restaurant. Trackside, which relocated to Joplin from Webb City, has been open for about a month. Under the guidance of chef Mike Clark, it specializes in hamburger combos that include either onion rings or fries, and a medium drink. The basic combo starts at $8. 95 and goes up from there depending on what you want on your burger. You can also get salads, sandwiches and hand-breaded chicken tenders. Soon, a smoker will be in operation there. Check out the full menu at www. tracksideeats. com. The basic burger comes with pickles, onions, lettuce and tomato. I added American cheese and some jalapenos. This was a big burger. The patty was bigger than the bun. The onion rings were hot and crispy. This place gets two thumbs up. Hours are from 11 a. m. to 8 p. m. Monday through Friday, and 11 a. m. to 3 p. m. Saturday. By the way, the opening of Trackside is not the only food news coming out of the west side of Joplin. The former Mojo Burgers at Seventh Street and Maiden Lane has been razed to make way for a Starbucks, and a new Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet will be opening soon in the 2600 block of West Seventh Street. \n",

      "A 33-year-old Joplin man pleaded guilty Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court to robbery and firearm charges, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. James L. Gautney accepted a plea offer calling for concurrent sentences of 10 years for first-degree robbery and seven years for unlawful possession of a firearm. The plea deal dismissed related counts of armed criminal action and trafficking in stolen identities. Judge Dean Dankelson accepted the plea arrangement and assessed the defendant the agreed-upon length of sentences. Under state law, Gautney will be required to serve 85% of the 10 years before becoming eligible for parole. The convictions pertain to an incident Jan. 14 in the 1500 block of South Virginia Avenue in Joplin, according to a probable-cause affidavit. Police were called to the scene when William Harter caught Gautney inside his parked vehicle and Gautney threatened him with a handgun Harter had in the car. He ordered Harter to back off and fled with the gun, which police found in a backpack Gautney was carrying when they stopped him moments later. They also found a wallet, 11 credit cards and additional forms of identification belonging to other people in the backpack. \n",

Scott, of Joplin, was scheduled for a preliminary hearing Thursday in Jasper County Circuit Court on a charge of second-degree robbery. The charge was dismissed due to the unwillingness of the victim to pursue further prosecution of the matter. The charge pertained to an incident on Feb. 15. 2021, in the 600 block of South Joplin Avenue. A probable-cause affidavit filed with the charge alleged that Scott confronted the younger male and his friend in an underground parking garage, punched both of them and demanded that the one give him his cellphone and pass code.

      "Let’s end the year on a positive note. Today and Friday, we’ll take a look at 10 reasons to be optimistic about Joplin, about where we are and where we are going. Let’s start by looking at the some numbers — the dashboard, if you will. 1. The unemployment rate for the Joplin metro area (Jasper and Newton counties) has been in record-low territory for much of the year. The Joplin unemployment rate was 2. 4% in November, which is where it has been since the summer, with the exception of 2. 3% in September. This is the lowest the unemployment rate has been since at least 1990, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center. Anybody who wants a job can get one. 2. Joplin construction is also in near-record territory. Construction in the city hit $224. 5 million for the fiscal year that ran from Nov. 1, 2021, through Oct. 31, 2022, according to city building permit records. It’s the second time in three years that Joplin has climbed over $200 million. (Total building in Joplin for the year that ended Oct. 31, 2020, came to nearly $246 million. ) That rivals the construction that took place in 2012 and 2013, when tornado building was taking place. 3. Joplin’s downtown is seeing its most dramatic levels of investment in decades, maybe in a century, with the new Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex and the Jasper County Courthouse in Joplin, which opens next month. There are two new buildings planned for the 900 block of Main Street, as well as the restoration of many iconic buildings, such as the Olivia, the Downtown Y and many others. 4. The newest Joplin school, Dover Hill Elementary, opens to students next week. That means that nearly every school in Joplin has been dramatically upgraded or replaced in the past 15 years, beginning with the approval of a $57. 3 million bond issue for the middle schools in 2007. Many of our schools were replaced following the tornado. Now, with Dover Hill, two more older and outdated buildings, West Central and Columbia, have been replaced. Think about where we were just 15 years ago, and where we are as 2023 begins. This represents the biggest investment in school buildings in the city’s history. 5. Joplin’s 150th birthday is coming up, with celebrations and events next year. What would the city’s founders think to look upon their community today? They would recognize that we continue to have challenges, just as they did, but they surely would marvel at how far we’ve come and at what’s coming. Coming Friday: Five more good things. \n",

      "A 20-year-old man this week was allowed to withdraw a prior plea of guilty that he had entered in a Carthage statutory rape case in order to plead to a lesser offense of child molestation. Blake Gonzalez-Reyes pleaded guilty Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court to third-degree child molestation in a new plea agreement calling for his sentence to be served at the state's sex offender assessment unit and the court to review the case after 120 days for possible placement on probation. Judge Dean Dankelson set a sentencing hearing for Jan. 30.  Gonzalez-Reyes had pleaded guilty in July to first-degree statutory rape in the case involving a 13-year-old victim and a second defendant, Roldy E. DeLeon, 22, of Carthage. The two men picked up three minors in Joplin in March 2021 and gave them a ride to Carthage, where DeLeon purchased alcohol and took them to a residence for the night. The three juveniles were reported missing overnight, and Carthage police located two of them in a park the following day and learned that the third may have been a victim of statutory rape. Further investigation determined that both DeLeon and Gonzalez-Reyes had sex with the girl. DeLeon, who initially faced two counts of first-degree statutory rape, pleaded guilty in July to a reduced charge of second-degree statutory rape and was sentenced to seven years, with the term to be served at the sex offender assessment unit and the court to review the matter after 120 days for possible placement on probation.     Assistant Prosecutor Taylor Haas told the Globe that Gonzalez-Reyes' first plea deal called for the same placement and court review. But the state subsequently informed the court that a 120-day review could not be granted in a conviction for first-degree statutory rape. Gonzalez-Reyes was allowed to withdraw his plea, and the new plea offer was made. He could be assessed from three to 10 years as an underlying sentence on the conviction. \n",

      "A 21-year-old woman testified this week that Trey Albertson wouldn’t take no for an answer and sexually assaulted her July 2 at his residence in Duquesne. Her testimony and that of a police officer at a preliminary hearing Thursday in Jasper County Circuit Court proved sufficient to convince Associate Judge Joseph Hensley there was probable cause for Albertson, 27, of Duquesne, to stand trial on a single count of first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sodomy. The woman told the court that she first met Albertson through friends about two weeks before the assault. The day in question she had gone to a campground in the company of a male friend who knew Albertson and others who were there drinking and hanging out, she said. Her friend disappeared after a while and she was left in the company of Albertson and a friend of his and ended up going with them to his place. The defendant’s friend fell asleep and Albertson lay down with her on a couch before eventually pulling her up and walking her into a bedroom where he got undressed. She said she told him at that point, and repeatedly, “I want to go home. ”But he just kept responding: “After. ” “Were you able to get the defendant off you?” Assistant Prosecutor Taylor Haas asked. “No,” she said. He then proceeded to rape her, she told the court. Afterward, he walked her back out to the couch in the living room, where he fell asleep and she finally managed to get up and leave, and call her father. Haas asked why she didn’t just leave after he was done with her instead of returning to the couch with him. She said she was afraid of what might happen if she tried to get away and he woke up. “Trey didn’t drag you down the hall, did he?,” defense attorney Jay O’Donnell asked her on cross-examination. “It was like him leading me,” she said. “Grabbed my hand with him leading me. ”The judge set a hearing Jan. 18 for Albertson’s initial appearance on the charges in a trial division of the court. \n",

Mason, of Carthage, pleaded guilty in Jasper County Circuit Court to a reduced charge of misdemeanor child endangerment in a plea deal dismissing a second count of domestic assault. She had been charged with a felony child abuse as well as second-degree domestic assault. The abuse was brought to the attention of Carthage police Oct. 24, 2021, by a reporting party who had observed marks on the back of Mason's son in the shape of a handprint. The boy also had complained of a headache from having his head slammed against a door, according to a probable-cause affidavit filed with the charges. Both the defendant's son and daughter reported being physically abused by their mother on a regular basis during separate interviews at the Children's Center in Joplin. The son said his mother hit him in the back after slamming his head into a door on the one occasion in question, and the daughter told investigators that she witnessed that particular abuse of her brother, who has cerebral palsy. When questioned by police, Mason denied having slammed the boy's head into a door but said she had tripped over a vacuum cord and accidentally pushed him into the door, according to the affidavit. The document states that she also acknowledged that she \"probably lost her cool and should have stopped spanking\" her son. Judge David Mouton assessed Mason one year in jail on the conviction for child endangerment, with execution of the sentence suspended and the defendant placed on unsupervised probation for two years.

Morgan, 27, accepted a plea offer Dec. 12 in Jasper County Circuit Court to dismiss felony counts of first-degree child endangerment and resisting arrest, as well misdemeanor counts of possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, in exchange for his plea to a misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated. The Jasper County prosecutor’s office said under the agreement Morgan will be pleading guilty in a lower court to a misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated and be granted a suspended imposition of sentence. Carthage police attempted to stop a vehicle the defendant was driving on March 4, 2021, for a traffic violation, but he purportedly kept driving, running several stop signs and passing other vehicles in a dangerous manner, according to a probable-cause affidavit. By not stopping, he prompted the resisting arrest charge. When he finally did come to a stop, police found a juvenile in the back seat, which prompted the endangerment charge, and a small amount of marijuana in Morgan’s possession. He failed field sobriety tests, according to the affidavit. \n",

      "A Greenville, Texas, man pleaded guilty to a reduced charge Thursday in an assault of a woman more than a year ago on the Missouri Southern State University campus. Dalan D. Thomas pleaded guilty in Jasper County Circuit Court to a misdemeanor count of assault in a plea agreement with the prosecutor's office. Associate Judge Joseph Hensley accepted the plea arrangement and assessed Thomas six months in jail with execution of the sentence suspended and the defendant placed on unsupervised probation for one year and ordered to have no contact with the victim. Campus police met with the defendant's girlfriend, an MSSU student, on Oct. 25 when she reported receiving text messages from him stating that he was outside her dormitory and intending her harm. She told police that he had taken her phone from her the previous night and had read messages on the phone between her and a third party. He had reacted by slapping her four times and choking her while they were in a vehicle parked on a campus lot. \n",

      "A Jasper County judge decided after a preliminary hearing Thursday that a Carthage-area man should stand trial on charges that he sexually abused and exploited an underage girl and raped her once she turned 17. The charges against 43-year-old Johnathin R. Maggard were amended prior to the hearing in Jasper County Circuit Court to single counts of second-degree rape, second-degree sodomy, sexual exploitation of a minor and possession of child pornography, as well as two counts of violating a protection order. After testimony by the girl and an investigator with the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department and the Southwest Missouri Cyber Crimes Task Force, Associate Judge Joseph Hensley ordered Maggard to stand trial on those six counts. The girl testified that Maggard began touching her inappropriately when she was underage and proceeded to force sexual intercourse on her after she turned 17. She said Maggard threatened to “ruin” her life if she ever told anyone about the abuse. The girl told the court that sometimes the defendant would record them having sex. Under cross-examination by defense attorney Kelsey Kent, she said she never recorded such encounters herself. “Did you ever want to have sex with (Maggard)?” Assistant Prosecutor Taylor Haas asked the girl on redirect examination. “No,” she said. Detective Richard Corbett told the court that the defendant’s computer and cellphone were seized after a family member reported suspected sexual abuse of the girl by the defendant. He said “a data dump” of the computer turned up two still images and a video of suspected child pornography believed to show Maggard engaged in a sexual assault of the girl. While the face of the adult male in the video is never shown, Maggard is identifiable in some of the still photos retrieved by investigators, Corbett said. On cross-examination, the detective did acknowledge that he could not rule out the possibility of someone else having used Maggard’s computer for nefarious purposes. \n",

      "A Jasper County judge sentenced a Carthage man Monday to 15 years in prison for molesting an 8-year-old girl in August 2021. A jury had convicted Elmer A. Nieto, 46, of second-degree child molestation but acquitted him of more serious charges of statutory rape and statutory sodomy at a two-day trial in October. Nieto, who could have been assessed up to life in prison on the statutory rape and sodomy counts, faced a punishment range of five to 15 years on the lesser offense of molestation. Circuit Judge Gayle Crane assessed the maximum prison term for the conviction at the conclusion of the defendant’s sentencing hearing Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court. The molestation of the girl came to light when her mother noticed a mark on her chest that she suspected was hickey and asked her how she got it. The girl tried to pass it off as an accidental bruise before breaking down in tears and telling her that Nieto was responsible, the mother testified at trial. The mother notified some other family members and police, and the girl was examined and interviewed at the Children’s Center in Joplin. The allegations of rape and sodomy emerged during counseling sessions in the weeks that followed. The girl’s brother read their mother’s victim-impact statement for her at the sentencing hearing. The mother said her daughter remains terrified of Nieto and that her other children have been affected psychologically by what happened to their sibling and are requiring counseling. The mother said in her statement that she disagrees with the jury’s verdict clearing the defendant of the two most serious charges. She said Nieto stole her daughter’s innocence “without any remorse” and asked that the court mete out the maximum prison time allowed by law. Defense attorney Charles Genisio, who argued at the trial that the girl’s disclosures were influenced by the suspicions her mother was expressing at home to other family members, called two female co-workers of Nieto to testify to his character as a respectful, “well-mannered” man who seemed incapable to them of molesting a child. One of them told the court that the defendant has been most helpful to her as a single mother and that he has never done anything inappropriate with her two girls. His girlfriend of 25 years testified that in her opinion Nieto was unjustly accused by a family he had helped in the past. \n",

      "A Joplin doctor, Heather D. Stelling, 55, pleaded guilty in federal court Friday to providing false information in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to which she was not entitled, according to the U. S. attorney’s office for the Western District of Missouri. Stelling waived her right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U. S. Chief Magistrate Judge David Rush to one count of making a false statement relating to health care. According to the statement:Stelling owned and operated Stelling Pain Management in Joplin. According to the plea agreement, Stelling continued to practice medicine from Sept. 12-24, 2018, despite believing that her medical license was suspended during that time. Under state law, a Missouri licensed physician who fails to file or fails to pay any Missouri state tax for three years can face license suspension. The Missouri Department of Revenue erroneously informed Missouri’s Board of Registration for the Healing Arts that Stelling had failed to file and/or pay state income taxes. Stelling was informed that, in order to avoid her license being suspended, she needed to obtain a certificate of tax compliance from the department by Sept. 12, 2018, which she failed to do. Stelling’s license to practice medicine was erroneously suspended on Sept. 12, 2018. On Sept. 24, 2018, the Department of Revenue provided the Board of Registration for the Healing Arts with a certificate of tax compliance, Stelling’s license was reinstated, and her suspension was subsequently expunged. “Stelling knew that Medicare and Medicaid would not pay claims for services rendered to beneficiaries while her license was suspended. In order to receive payment, she billed Medicare and Medicaid for services rendered to beneficiaries while she believed her license was suspended by falsely claiming dates of service outside the period of her suspension. Stelling altered the dates of service in her patient’s records to conceal that the service had been rendered when she believed her license was suspended. ”According to the U. S. attorney’s office, Stelling altered at least 24 of her patient records to make it appear as though she had not treated the patient during the time that she believed her medical license was suspended. “Stelling billed Medicare and Medicaid for these services, knowing that the services were supported, in part, by false statements she had made in the patients’ records. ”As a result of Stelling’s conduct, Medicare and MO HealthNet (Missouri’s Medicaid program) paid $146,026 in claims they otherwise would not have paid. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Stelling must pay $127,750 in restitution to Medicare and $18,276 in restitution to MO HealthNet. Stelling is subject to a sentence of up to five years in federal prison without parole. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office. \n",

      "A Longmont, Colorado, man took a plea offer this week on a charge that he beat his brother with a pool cue two years ago while visiting his home in Joplin. Danny P. Alford, 45, pleaded guilty Monday in Jasper County Circuit Court to a reduced of misdemeanor assault in a plea arrangement and was sentenced to one year in jail with execution of the sentence suspended and the defendant placed on unsupervised probation for two years. He had been facing a felony count of second-degree assault in the case. The defendant's brother, Johnny Alford, testified at a preliminary hearing in March 2021 that he and Danny Alford had been drinking and eating together at his home when Danny Alford got mad about his brother's disciplining of his daughter over her use of a cellphone. Johnny Alford said his brother started punching him, and that he threw Danny Alford down some stairs to get him off him. When the fight resumed near the bottom of the stairs, the daughter and another woman pulled Danny Alford off his brother and got him out of the house into the garage. Johnny Alford testified that he followed them out to the garage to tell his brother to leave, but Danny Alford grabbed a pool stick, took it apart and began beating him with the thicker half of the cue. He wound up with a gash on his head that required nine staples to close. \n",

      "A Webb City woman on Thursday was ordered to stand trial on a drug trafficking charge of possession of 2 grams of powder that proved to be a mix of methamphetamine and fentanyl. Associate Judge Joseph Hensley decided at the conclusion of a preliminary hearing in Jasper County Circuit Court that there was probable cause for Rebekkah C. Gage, 39, to stand trial on a count of second-degree trafficking in drugs. A police officer testified at the hearing that he was responding Aug. 19 to a report of a stolen moped possibly having been seen outside Wendy's restaurant in Webb City. He said he spotted Gage standing by the moped with a male companion. She ran, he said, and he chased her, first in his patrol car and then on foot. Along the way, she discarded a purse in which a folded piece of paper was found containing about 2 grams of powder, he told the court. The powder tested positive for both methamphetamine and fentanyl. She was arrested and charged by the Jasper County prosecutor's office with a Class B felony count of second-degree trafficking, which carries from five to 15 years. Two grams of most controlled substances, including meth, are generally regarded as a personal use amount and constitutes the Class C felony of possession, which carries a punishment range of three to 10 years. It normally takes 30 grams of meth, or 10 milligrams or more of fentanyl, to be charged with the higher level of offense in Missouri. But the state's controlled substances statute also allows the charging of someone with second-degree trafficking if they are in possession of \"any compound, mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of fentanyl, or carfentanil, or their optical isomers or analogues. \"A date for Gage's initial appearance in a trial division of the court had yet to be set by the close of building hours Thursday, according to electronic court records. \n",

      "A big chill is hitting our area. No, not the wintry blast of cold weather the area is experiencing — but the chills and fever that come with rampant spread of the flu virus. Federal health officials recently said that 7. 5% of outpatient medical visits during the week ending Nov. 26 — the most recent week for which data was available — were due to flu-like illnesses. That’s as high as the peak of the 2017-18 flu season and higher than any season since. Joplin-area hospitals also are reporting a surge in patients with the flu, they told the Globe this week. Freeman Health System reported 715 positive lab results for influenza A and 38 for influenza B during November, officials there said. The health system reported only 26 positive lab results for the flu in November of last year. Mercy Hospital Joplin reports similar increases. “We are definitely seeing an uptick in influenza, especially influenza A, both in the outpatient and inpatient side,” said Dr. Eden Esguerra, infectious disease specialist. “I think we have not seen the peak yet, and that’s why we are sounding an alarm. ”Public health officials predicted earlier this fall that we would face a tough season for flu and upper respiratory infections. They were right. In fact, it is worse than they had feared. The flu hit early — the flu season usually doesn’t really get rolling until December or January — and officials also are seeing what some have termed a “tripledemic” of flu, RSV and COVID-19 infections. “(The viruses) have symptoms that overlap, so it’s really difficult to say for sure you definitely have the flu, you definitely have COVID or you definitely have RSV,” Esguerra said. The only way to know for sure is to get tested. And the situation is likely to get worse. “Especially with the holidays and people getting together, I imagine it will not get better until the end of January and beginning of February,” said Angela Tucker, director of system quality improvement and infection prevention at Freeman. But it isn’t too late to protect yourself. Get your flu shot. Make sure you are up-to-date on your COVID-19 boosters. If you have health conditions that put you at increased risk, take precautions such as frequent hand-washing and masking when you go into busy places or indoor spaces. Vitally, if you are sick, stay home. Don’t contribute to the problem if you can avoid it. \n",

      "A double-digit lead in the first half was whittled down to 4 points in the second, but the Thomas Jefferson boys basketball team got a big night from Tyler Brouhard and dispatched visiting Lockwood 66-59 on Monday night in Joplin. Brouhard scored a team-high 25 points and made 13 shots at the free throw line to help the Cavaliers improve to 7-1 on the season. Lockwood fell to 3-2 with the loss. In the first halfThomas Jefferson never trailed in the game and used an early 10-0 run to lead 14-4 late in the first quarter. It was 19-10 at the end of the first. The lead grew to as many as 16 points in the second quarter — a 3-pointer by sophomore Ethan Renger made it 33-17 with 3:58 remaining. Renger had three triples in the first half and the Cavaliers made six as a team in the first two quarters. With consecutive scores from senior Elijah Kerr, the Tigers cut it to 38-30 at the half. In the second halfTwice in the third quarter the visitors pulled within 4 points — it was 45-41 after sophomore Nik Thieman scored for Lockwood. But the Tigers didn’t score on their next nine possessions and the Cavaliers did some damage from the free throw line. Brouhard made 8 of 9 attempts from the line in the third quarter, and Thomas Jefferson made 11 of 13 as a team. The freebies helped push it to 54-41 in the third. Thomas Jefferson led by 13 with 4:37 left in the game, but then didn’t score until the final minute. With 1:09 remaining, the lead was down to 61-56, but senior Jay Ball scored from the floor and senior Kip Atteberry and Brouhard added three free throws in the final 26 seconds. Key statsBrouhard scored 18 of his 25 points in the second half. Ball scored 15, senior Levi Triplett added 11, Renger had 9, Atteberry finished with 4 and Kohl Thurman scored 2. The Cavaliers were 21 of 32 at the line. For Lockwood, Dalton Mamen scored 29, Kerr had 11 and Henry Schnelle scored 8. The Tigers were 7 of 14 at the line. What they’re saying“We took control there early in the first quarter. Felt like we had control for the most part. We kind of got out of rhythm toward the end and didn’t execute as well as we’d like down the stretch, but got settled back down and did what we had to do to finish it off. ”— TJ head coach Chris Myers“We’ve got guys battling sickness and injuries. The team as a whole really stepped up and did what they had to do. Had some guys step up and make big shots early. Levi Triplett and Ethan Renger hit some big shots for us. We always lean on Jay Ball and Tyler Brouhard to carry us but we talk about other guys having to step up when those guys are drawing a lot of attention and those guys did a good job for us early. The guys hit enough free throws down the stretch to get it done. ”— Myers“We knew it was going to be really tough from the jump from the size perspective. We really don’t have anybody that matches up with (Jay) Ball very well. One of the biggest things was if TJ shot well we were going to be in trouble. I really thought we played well considering the fact they hit six 3’s in the first half and probably around 10 for the game. If you had told me before the game they would hit that many, I would have probably thought we were going to lose by a lot more if I’m being honest. (Jay) Ball was definitely key to our game plan, trying to limit him and I’m sure he still ended up having a pretty good game. ”— Lockwood head coach Ethan BakerUp nextThomas Jefferson is done for the year.

      "A judge decided at the conclusion of a preliminary hearing Thursday in Jasper County Circuit Court that there is probable cause for a Webb City man to stand trial on a count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Associate Judge Joseph Hensley ordered Port A. H. Keough Sr. , 52, to stand trial on the charge and set his initial appearance in a trial division of the court on Dec. 15. Keough was driving a vehicle that a Joplin police officer stopped May 10 after checking its license plates and learning that the registered owner had an outstanding warrant. The officer testified at the hearing that Keough, who proved not to be the owner, had no driver's license or proof of insurance, and a check of his license status showed his licence was suspended. The officer said Keough acknowledged to her that there was a firearm in the vehicle, but said it belonged to the owner and not him. But the gun was on the driver's seat, and Keough is prohibited from possessing firearms due to a prior felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance. \n",

      "A judge sent a Carthage man to prison Monday for seven years on convictions for possession of methamphetamine and a firearm. Judge Dean Dankelson assessed Johnny Lopez, 32, the prison time at a sentencing hearing in Jasper County Circuit Court. The judge assessed Lopez concurrent terms of seven years each for possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a firearm, and of four years for a separate count of resisting arrest. Lopez pleaded guilty to the charges in October in a plea agreement with the Jasper County prosecutor's office. The drug and firearm convictions stem from an arrest by a Carthage police officer responding to a trespassing complaint June 28, 2021. Lopez was stopped by the officer, and several bags containing a total of 22 grams of methamphetamine and a gun holster were found in a backpack he was carrying. A probable-cause affidavit states that a revolver also was found in a search of the area where he was stopped. The resisting arrest conviction pertains to an arrest in October 2021. \n",

      "After a quarter of basketball Monday night, Webb City’s girls basketball team was on pace to win by 116 points. They didn’t. But after the Cardinals’ red-hot start, it would have taken a historic comeback by visiting Pittsburg, Kansas, to knock off Webb City. The Cardinals led 32-3 after a quarter, had three players score in double figures by halftime and cruised to a 77-29 win inside the Cardinal Dome, improving to 5-4 in the process. Webb City, which averaged 41 points in its first eight games, had already surpassed that total by halftime. Head coach Lance Robbins said it was as simple as shooting the ball better. “We haven’t shot the ball real well from outside all year long,” he said. “We’ve been kind of inconsistent with that. Tonight we shot the ball well and I think once we saw one or two go in our confidence grew. Hopefully something we can build on going forward. ”The team made five 3-pointers in the first half and eight in the game. Senior Kate Brownfield knocked down three of those and had 20 points by halftime. Senior Izzy Lopez added three more and had 10 points in the first half, and sophomore Sami Mancini chipped in 11 more first-half points. The success all started on the defensive end, though, according to Robbins. The Cardinals forced at least eight turnovers in the first quarter and didn’t allow a field goal for more than 10 minutes to start the game. “I thought our kids came out tonight and really got off to a good start defensively,” Robbins said. “That started with our two seniors up front in Izzy Lopez and Kate Brownfield. They were at the head of our press and I thought they did a good job of speeding up the game and getting some turnovers. ”It was a 44-8 game at halftime. Mancini, who had 8 in the first quarter, added 6 more in the third. Brownfield scored 5 in the period and junior Malorie Stanley added 4. It added up to a 64-22 lead with eight minutes remaining. Brownfield nearly matched Pittsburg on her own; she scored a game-high 27 points. Mancini finished with 17 and Lopez totaled 13. Stanley scored 7, juniors Mia Robbins and Kim Martin each had 4, junior Dawsyn Decker had 3 and freshman Kylee Sargeant scored 2. Pittsburg was led by Jacqueline Hall, who scored 19 with 14 of those in the second half. The Cardinals will go for one more on Tuesday when they travel to Seneca. They’re off until January after that. “We’ve done some really good things defensively to this point,” Robbins said. “We realize we’ve got to get a little better offensively. Hopefully after tonight we can carry that over tomorrow night and continue to build on that over Christmas break going into the second half of the season. ”\n",

The Class 2 No. 9 Cougars were tied with visiting Miller 8-8 early on, then went on a 22-0 run before halftime and finished off the visitors 66-31 to improve to 4-1 on the year. In the first halfAfter Miller tied it at 8, Caleb Quade scored three straight baskets. He did the same thing to open the second quarter. By the time he scored again at the 4:52 mark, he already had 16 points and College Heights led 30-8. Miller committed nine turnovers during the run and failed to score for 15 straight possessions. Bo Sitton, who scored 5 in the first half, recorded at least two steals during the stretch. The Cougars led 35-14 at the break. In the second halfA running clock, for one. College Heights’ lead grew to 30 on a three-point play by Quade with 1:15 left in the third. It was 54-26 at the end of the third. In the fourth, Logan Decker made a free throw to extend it to 31. With 4:02 left, Jayce Walker banked in a three pointer to make it 62-29. It was a 35-point game soon after when Quade scored after grabbing an offensive rebound. College Heights only shot two free throws in the first half. The Cougars were 4 of 6 in the second half. Miller didn’t take a single free throw attempt in the second half, and missed its only attempt in the game. Final statsQuade was the big scorer, leading the team with 25 points. He was also the only Cougar in double figures. Steven Calandro, Curtis Davenport and Walker each scored 8. Miller’s Nate Hill scored 7 and Owen Pritchett added 6. What they’re saying“It was 8-8 and next thing we made a big run right there. We just did a better job on defense and got some steals, got some layups, got some good shots. Yeah, it was just a matter of refocusing on what they were supposed to be doing. ”— College HeightsCoach Eric Johnson“We needed him (Caleb Quade). Up at the Pierce City tournament the last two games he didn’t play as well as he’s capable of so he was making up for not playing well over there maybe. That gives us that second scorer inside 15 feet along with Curtis. Can’t depend on him being the only one. Caleb stepped up and had a good night, a good first half for us. ”— Johnson“They’re a really good ball team. They’ve got a bunch of big kids. When you’re playing against some 5-10, 5-11 kids and you’re getting out-rebounded, you’re executing but not the right way at times and it really kills you. They did a good job, they’re a good team. ”— Miller coach Brandon Weiss Worth noting: Curtis Davenport, a 6-foot-5 senior for the Cougars, was recognized before the game for scoring 1,000 career points. He reached the milestone in a season-opening win against Providence Academy. He entered the season needing 29 points, and scored 32 in the opener. Up next: At 4-1, College Heights is off to an identical start from last season. The Cougars opened 6-1 then and finished 24-5. They travel to Hermitage on Friday, and Galena, Kansas, on Monday.

      "An agreement for the city of Joplin to give $1. 5 million of its nearly $13. 8 million American Rescue Plan Act funding to Missouri Southern State University will be considered Monday by the City Council. The money would go toward the $30 million MSSU needs to build a Health Science Innovation Center. The center is one of the capital projects to receive funding from Gov. Mike Parson's $470 million allocation in the state budget for building needs at the state's colleges and universities. Dean Van Galen, university president, told the governor during a February visit to MSSU that Joplin serves as a hub for health sciences for the Four-State Area. “This will help us expand our health science programs, including nursing, but more than anything provide an opportunity to partner with businesses, health care professionals and our community to further that broader vision of who we are and what we could be in the region as a center for excellence in health care and health science,” Van Galen said. MSSU is to receive $15 million from the state's State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds from the American Rescue Plan Act for the project. The state allocation will need to be matched using investments from governmental bodies such as cities, counties, private foundations and individual donors. The City Council in July voted on priorities for use of the city's ARPA funding from a list 70 potential projects. That list was compiled from city staff selections and council selections.  Mayor Doug Lawson asked at that meeting about the ranking of a grant sought by Missouri Southern State University, which came in low on city staff’s list but higher on the council list. It was explained at that meeting that Missouri Southern officials said there is a critical need for health care workers in Joplin’s medical and dental industries. The council then agreed to move funding for the MSSU project to the top 20 priority list. Terms of the city's agreement with MSSU for the money state that the university would need to raise all its needed funding by June 30, 2024. If the university does not raise the money by that date, the agreement can be terminated.  \n",

The Carthage football team will make its fourth Final Four appearance of the last six seasons on Saturday when the top-ranked Tigers (11-1) play host to the second-ranked Francis Howell Vikings (12-0) in a Class 5 state semifinal at David Haffner Stadium. Kickoff is slated for 1 p. m. in Carthage. The Tigers are seeking their second state championship in program history. Their first was claimed in 2019 with a 27-21 overtime win in a title game against Jackson. Carthage spent part of its Thanksgiving holiday out on the practice field in preparations for Saturday’s heavyweight tilt. “Anytime you get to practice on Thanksgiving, and we did it a few years ago as well, it’s certainly a really good experience,” Carthage head coach Jon Guidie said. “The kids were excited, families came out to watch. It’s just a special time for everybody and a reward for how well they’ve done this season. ”The Tigers’ next test will be perhaps their most challenging one of the season. Francis Howell not only enters the contest with an unblemished record but has also dominated its opposition throughout the course of the year. The Vikings are averaging 49. 4 points per game while limiting their opponents to 13. 9 ppg. They haven’t scored less than 35 points in a contest this season, and their closest game was a 35-19 triumph over Troy Buchanan in Week 5. “They’re very impressive to watch on film,” Guidie said of the Vikings. “There’s talent everywhere. They have an explosive running back similar to Luke (Gall), and he starts both ways at linebacker and running back. Their quarterback is very talented and a dual-threat kid, and they’ve got tall, lanky receivers that can go get the football. A lot of those kids play both ways, too. ”Francis Howell QB Adam Shipley has thrown for over 1,700 yards as well as 23 touchdowns with seven interceptions. His top target, wide receiver Jude James, has 24 catches for 559 yards and six scores. Brady Hultman is the Vikings’ workhorse running back, having rushed for 1,059 yards and 20 TDs on 135 carries. Carthage, coming off a 35-14 win over Lebanon in the state quarterfinals, is averaging 40. 9 ppg while holding its opponents to 14. 9 ppg. Gall, a two-way standout and Air Force Academy commit, has rushed for a whopping 1,896 yards and 38 TDs on 232 carries. He also leads the CHS defense with 92 tackles, seven tackles for loss and two fumble recoveries at linebacker. Carthage has another formidable rusher in QB Cooper Jadwin, who’s amassed 1,219 yards and 11 scores on 152 carries. He’s also completed 67 of 123 passes for 1,145 yards and six TDs. Jadwin missed the second half of last week’s game against Lebanon due to an injury. Clay Kinder filled in for him at QB and logged 81 yards of total offense and a pair of TDs. Wide receiver Hudson Moore leads the CHS offense in receiving with 38 catches for 591 yards and six TDs. Gall has 13 catches for 326 yards and two scores. Micah Lindsey has 84 tackles and a team-high 19 tackles for loss for Carthage, while Mason Frisinger has 55 tackles and a team-best 16 pass breakups. Tayvion Bailey leads the way in interceptions with four, and Linder has 73 tackles and two fumble recoveries. “Just looking at the weather and the rain that’s expected (on Saturday), ball security is probably going to be a factor,” Guidie said. “You have to hold on to the football. We would like to be able to work the clock a little bit and keep their explosive athletes on the sideline. “They (the Vikings) also have a very good kicker (Josh Deal). He’s one of the best kickers in the state and has made like 81 extra points. “I don’t know how many touchbacks he has, but I’m betting it’s a lot. . . . So special teams could play a factor as far as field position and all of those things. ”The victor on Saturday will advance to the state championship game on Dec. 2 to take on either Fort Osage or Central (Cape Girardeau) in Columbia, Missouri. \n",

      "As is typical when ushering in a new year, I’ve been reflecting on what the last year has brought us, particularly in the arts. We had a variety of additions to our arts menu last year, but the downtown district was the beneficiary of the major ones. A mural recognizing contributions of African Americans to our community was added in the district, which also saw the opening of the Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex. Additionally, the Downtown Arts District spearheaded an effort to restore Spiva Park at Fourth and Main streets. These three contributions not only add to the downtown creative climate but will also become economic drivers as they attract more people and businesses to the district. They fortify the efforts to create a thriving, truly urban downtown setting. Black historyLocal Black groups joined with arts organizations to bring about the Black history mural located on the north exterior wall of Bruce’s Point of View at First and Main streets. Kansas City muralist Alexander Austin worked in last summer’s blazing heat to create the mural. Painted primarily in black and white, the mural includes images of two of Joplin’s native sons, literary great Langston Hughes and jazz saxophonist Charles McPherson, surrounded by musicians who performed here in yesteryear. Among them are Cab Calloway, Louie Armstrong, Marion Anderson, Sammy Davis Jr. , Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. It also includes references to local Black history — Lincoln School, which served Black students, and Melissa Cuther, one of the African American community’s trailblazers who taught at Lincoln School in the early 1900s. A banner at the mural’s top recognizes Joplin Uplift, a former newspaper that served the Black community. The mural project was a collaborative effort of Black organizations — the Langston Hughes Cultural Society and Minnie Hackney Community Center — and arts nonprofits that included Connect2Culture, Post Art Library, the Joplin Arts District and Spiva Center for the Arts, along with Visit Joplin. As part of their fundraising efforts for the project, they brought McPherson home for a concert last February. The jazz great, who has carved out a music career spanning six decades, also took time from an international tour to perform at the mural dedication in September. Not only does the mural add to our rich display of public art, but it also gives long overdue recognition of the contributions of our Black community. That segment of our population has been underrepresented in local recorded history, as well as in public art. Cornell ComplexJoplin’s most monumental arts project was construction of the Cornell Complex, which opened in November. The visual and performing arts complex at Seventh and Joplin streets encompasses 37,000 square feet of space in sleek, 21st century styling. Its exterior spaces feature sculptures, including a memorial tribute to the 161 people who lost their lives in Joplin’s 2011 tornado. The first floor features a reception area and gift shop for Spiva, and a state-of-the-art performance hall with customized seating that can accommodate up to 435 people for performances or be reconfigured for receptions and other events. On the second floor are four galleries of Spiva, designed with environmental and safety controls that meet national standards for hosting world class exhibits. It includes a gallery for rotating exhibits of the 300 pieces in Spiva’s permanent collection. This is the first time Spiva has had such a gallery. The complex’s third floor houses offices of Connect2Culture, Spiva and Pro Musica, our local chamber music presenter, and community meeting rooms. It also includes classroom space for Spiva. Exterior balconies, one that can be used for private events, overlook an outdoor green that provides space for concerts, festivals, and other large-scale events. The $17. 5 million complex was constructed entirely through grants and private donations, including a $5 million lead contribution by the late Harry M. Cornell Jr. , former president and CEO of Leggett & Platt Inc. of Carthage. Spiva ParkThe Joplin Arts District, which encompasses 56 blocks in the central downtown, spearheaded an effort to refresh gardens and restore other elements of the 56-year-old Spiva Park. The improvements were completed in cooperation with the Joplin Parks and Recreation Department, volunteers from businesses, the Joplin Historical Society, the Joplin History and Mineral Museum, and descendants of the park’s founder, the late George A. Spiva, a local arts supporter and philanthropist. The restoration included cleaning and redesign of flowerbeds and planting of new flowers and shrubs. There was also installation of a 12-foot sign bearing the name of the park. Commissioned by local sculptor Jorge Leyva, the sign includes a replica of an iris, the city flower and a favorite of Spiva’s. Previously, the park was identified only by a small ground plaque. During cleaning of the the park’s flower beds, several specimens of minerals that helped build Joplin as a mining town were unearthed. They were cleaned and identified for a rock bed display that can be used for education purposes. The display includes zinc, lead, dolomite, chert, calcite and hemimorphite. This park has been long overdue for an upgrade. It speaks of the pride we have in our downtown area. \n",

      "At Joplin High School, my reputation is pretty well secured by this point. I’m the “phones are bad” teacher. This week a senior graduating early gave me a gushing, emotional goodbye. Her last words before she walked out the door: “I’ll never look at my phone again without thinking of you!”I’ll take it. Last week, “60 Minutes” aired a segment about the more than 1,200 lawsuits that are now being brought by parents against major social media platforms. One stomach-turning portion of the piece featured a bereft mother and father whose daughter had died by suicide in her bedroom after an Instagram binge. Before you dismiss them as inattentive parents, they aren’t outliers: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows suicides in this country have increased by more than 30% since 2000, with adolescents — especially adolescent girls — being the very hardest hit. Why isn’t anything changing about the way we approach these devices?It’s true that no one here in Joplin has the power to make Instagram or Snapchat less toxic, but what we can do in our own community — and in our own homes — is craft an environment that is free from those influences. I have written here in the Globe on more than one occasion about the sheer futility of individual teachers prohibiting cellphone use in our classrooms. The current approach to cellphone use in the classroom is to make it the problem — the failure, really — of the teacher. This is just a repeat of what we saw from leaders from the top all the way down during the pandemic: “Let the states/cities/businesses/schools decide. ” Unpopular decisions wouldn’t have to be made at the highest levels of our society. Cans can be kicked, and passive voice constructions can be used to make actively unhealthy environments appear as immutable as the law of gravity. We are overdue for a new way of doing school. We need to ban students from having cellphones on their person on school premises and for the entire duration of the school day. I think a system that would operate like a coat check is the most reasonable/achievable/elegant solution. Student takes out a phone? “Oh, I’m sorry. You can’t have that here. Please go deposit that at the phone check in the front office. ”Problem solved. When people finally understand what change I am advocating for, I hear one or more of a few typical rejoinders:• “What about school shootings? I bought my son/daughter a phone so that I know that they’re safe! No one is going to take it from them!” Public education places no objective higher than the safekeeping of our students, but cellphones do not keep anyone safe. They are tools for communication. In the event of an emergency the first course of action for staff will be to ensure the safety of every student. Once an active threat is gone students can communicate their safety to their parents via school and staff phones. • “These devices are the future! We shouldn’t be prohibiting them in public school. We should be teaching students how to use them appropriately!” Look around. How many adults are just as addicted to these devices as the youth are? My wife and I no longer own smartphones because when we did they consistently took our attention away from each other and our children. On the subject of screens, Chris Anderson, the former editor of Wired, told The New York Times in 2018, “On the scale between candy and crack cocaine, it’s closer to crack cocaine. ” Teaching “moderation” is not realistic here, let alone something we are even doing for ourselves. • “The real problem the kids are facing is vaping! I don’t think anyone is going to get cancer from looking at a phone!” Yes, I really do hear this with some frequency. I don’t doubt for a minute that vaping can be detrimental to one’s health, but the social fabric of society isn’t unraveling because of vapes. Democracy isn’t destabilizing because of vapes. And no child ever killed themselves because of bullying that they encountered through a vape. Furthermore, such a statement reveals an ignorance of the actual scope of the damage these devices do to cognition. The research is becoming much clearer: These devices really do shorten attention spans. Our students are now habituated to a new stimulus every 15 or so seconds. On the whole, I see a dramatic decline in what texts students are capable of reading now as opposed to ten years ago. Ask any veteran teacher and they’ll tell you the same. Believe it or not, many students and staff are actually desperate for the level of restriction that I’m calling for. The same way that an addict will beg for their drugs to be taken away, our students don’t have the strength of will that it requires. They see phones and social media as just a sad reality of their routine. Indeed, countless students have told me how angry they are to be growing up in these times, and how often they have attempted to communicate this anguish to their parents — people who did get to have a childhood free from an addictive Pandora’s box in their pocket. At some point, people with power over the system of our public schools will have to stand up and say “Enough. ” There isn’t actually any legitimate reason to prolong that moment, but there are literally millions of good reasons — living all across this country — to do it now. \n",

      "CARL JUNCTION, Mo. — The Carl Junction girls basketball team has opened its season with two wins in its home tournament. The Bulldogs began the CJ Classic with a 53-39 win over Neosho on Monday night. On Tuesday, Carl Junction outlasted Springdale, Arkansas, 62-58. Those two wins have the Bulldogs in the championship game at 8:30 Thursday against Nevada. Head coach Brad Shorter believes his team’s experience is a big part of its 2-0 start. “The last month of practice has been exceptional,” Shorter said. “We’re ahead of where we’ve been in past years. Our kids having the experience and being in the program for as long as they have and knowing, one, what we expect of them, but, two, what we’re trying to accomplish, is a bit of a head start for us. ”Carl Junction has four returning starters from its 2021 campaign and players with prior varsity experience coming off of the bench as well. Those returning starters are seniors Destiny Buerge, Klohe Burk, Hali Shorter and junior Kylie Scott. Sophomore Dezi Williams has joined that bunch to complete the Bulldogs’ starting five. Shorter also mentioned having players who have stepped up to take on key roles coming off the bench. Some of those players are senior Allie Wrestler, junior Anna Burch, sophomore Shaye Buerge and freshman Jadyn Howard. That ability to step up and take on that extra responsibility was made possible by the leadership and experience within the team. “We have a freshman (and) a couple of sophomores that are getting quite a bit of time at the varsity level,” Shorter said. “Having some of these seniors, and juniors even, help direct them and mentor them has been a super valuable piece for our program. ”Shorter added that his upperclassmen do a good job guiding their peers by giving them a scouting report on an opponent or by helping them understand what the coach is asking of them during a practice. Shorter credits the team success to that athlete-on-athlete mentoring. With the early success, there have been some things that stood out to Shorter as what he considers “November basketball. ” Outside of Scott, who tallied 20 rebounds in the semifinal game, he said he would like to see better rebounding. Another thing the team is focusing on now is sharper passes and trying to stay crisp on deliveries. One thing that he’s noticed in the first two games is turnovers. After only 10 in Game 1 against Neosho, Shorter said that jumped to “quite a few more” against Springdale the next night. He knows it can be sloppy at times and that his team still needs to get their legs under them. “Our kids realizing and seeing that we need to be able to play at a good, strong, quick pace, but being able to be under control and patient and have enough poise about us is important,” Shorter added. What better way to do that than to work out the kinks in an early season tournament?“We’ve been able to see two great teams in Neosho and Springdale and, obviously, we’re going to see an exceptional team in Nevada,” Shorter said. “It’s hard to simulate game speed in practice, it really is. So, being able to have three quick games here is good for our basketball legs to help us get in shape and get to where we need to be. ”The Bulldogs will cap off the tournament against the Tigers Thursday. Shorter is looking at the two guards from Nevada in Clara Swearingen and Madyson Majors. Inside, he knows Abigail Heathman will be a threat. Defending the outside shooting and not allowing second chances are keys to the game for the Bulldogs. Nevada defeated Parkview 61-55 in the semifinal round and topped McDonald County 54-27 in the opening round. \n",

      "CARL JUNCTION, Mo. — Thursday night marked the fourth-straight year that Carl Junction and Nevada matched up in the Freeman Sports Medicine CJ Classic. And, for the fourth-straight year, it was the Bulldogs who emerged victorious. With a big effort in the fourth quarter, the Class 5 No. 3 Bulldogs managed a 53-47 win in the championship game and improved to 3-0 on the young season. “Nevada was great tonight, they were terrific,” Carl Junction coach Brad Shorter said. “Our kids found a way to win. That was a good ballgame for us to find a way but for three quarters, I’m not sure sometimes what we were doing and I think our kids would tell you that, too. We were a little out of whack and a lot of that has to do with Nevada. We found a way to win, the kids started playing there late in the fourth and making some things happen. We’ve just got to stay with it and continue to get better. ”It was a back-and-forth game throughout, with eight lead changes in the first half alone. Carl Junction led 23-20 at the break, and looked like it might take control early in the third with Nevada committing four turnovers on its first five possessions. That allowed the Bulldogs to take a 26-20 lead. Nevada (2-2) rallied to tie it at 27, and then took a four-point lead early in the fourth quarter after Nevada’s Clara Swearingen banked in a three pointer from deep to make it 40-36. Carl Junction’s duo of junior Kylie Scott and senior Destiny Buerge turned it on down the stretch, though, and combined for 16 points in the fourth quarter alone. and the Bulldogs were terrific from the free throw line in the final eight minutes, making 11 of 14 attempts. Nevada still led 45-41 with 3:32 left to play, but Scott grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled – she made both free throws. After Buerge came up with a steal, Scott grabbed another offensive rebound and scored to tie it. She was fouled on that play but missed the free throw. Buerge got the rebound and scored with 2:45 on the clock to make it 47-45, and Carl Junction didn’t trail again. Scott added a free throw with 2:16 left, and sophomore Dezi Williams scored to cap a 9-0 run that made it 50-45. Buerge added a free throw with 28 seconds remaining to make it a four-point game, and Scott scored in the waning seconds for the final total. Scott, who had nine points in the fourth quarter, finished with 21 and Buerge added 19. Williams finished with five, and sophomore DeShaye Buerge and freshman Jadyn Howard had two points each. All-tournament teamDestiny Buerge was named tournament MVP, and Scott was also named to the all-tournament team. Nevada’s Swearingen and Abbey Heathman were also honored, as well as Neosho’s Karlee Ellick and three others from Springdale and Parkview. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — A total of 741 residents, parents, staff, teachers and other members of the community responded to a survey offered by the Carthage Board of Education to help it determine what the community wants in its next superintendent of schools. The results of that survey and a survey of the seven board members themselves are aimed at helping in the selection of a candidate to succeed Superintendent Mark Baker, who plans to retire. “The primary purpose is to get you thinking as well about what you’re going to do in terms of leadership over the next few years,” said Bob Watkins, a consultant with the Missouri School Boards’ Association who is working with the Carthage board in its search. “Most of the responses had to do with either working with the board, responding to the board, listening to the board’s ideas and so on,” Watkins said. “So there’s no big surprise in any of that that I could see. ”Watkins said the community surveys brought out details about what the community thinks about the district. He said 444 responses named ethics and integrity as a key component for a superintendent, 420 responses talked about working in harmony with the staff, 400 surveys mentioned the need to keep the focus on students and their success, and 334 surveys mentioned the need for a superintendent to be visible in the community. He gave the board a report including hundreds of specific comments, without names. Board President Niki Cloud said she wasn’t surprised by the responses to the survey. “Overall, there wasn’t anything that jumped out at me that was totally surprising,” Cloud said. “I’m very happy with how many people took the time to do it. It was a little long, but I just wanted to make sure that we as the board grasped the understanding of what the community, the teachers, the parents, all those people wanted. ”Cloud said the board went through “more than a dozen applicants” in closed session at the meeting. “We hope to reach out to a handful of those candidates to offer interviews later, hopefully, this week,” she said. Cloud said the board is still hoping to announce a new superintendent sometime the week before Christmas. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — It was another hard-fought win for the Joplin boys basketball team. In a rematch of last year’s championship game, the Eagles had to overcome a 20-6 run in the first half but did enough down the stretch to come away with a 56-50 win Friday night over Raymore-Peculiar in the semifinals of the 76th Carthage Invitational. Joplin, 3-1, will tip off at 4:30 p. m. Saturday in the title game against Carthage, which downed Webb City 70-48 in Friday’s other semifinal. In the first halfIt was a good start for Joplin. Whit Hafer scored on a put back and then All Wright scored the next nine points for the Eagles, who led 11-3 less than four minutes in. But with 1:51 left in the first, the Panthers took a 13-11 lead and went on to lead 19-17 at the end of the quarter. Joplin trailed by as many as seven (26-19) in the second quarter and was down 31-27 at halftime. In the second halfThe Eagles tied it at 31 and then pulled ahead, but not for long. Ray-Pec led 41-40 with 1:50 left in the third. Wright then drilled a three from 22 feet at the buzzer to make it 43-41 Joplin, and the Eagles didn’t trail again. Hafer was big early in the fourth quarter. He scored the first basket of the period, sank two free throws and later dove on the floor for a loose ball and passed to Wright, who scored under the basket and was fouled. His three-point play made it 50-44 with 3:28 left to play. It was a four-point game with 2:41 to go. Joplin got two free throws from Wright and a basket from Quin Renfro assisted by Terrance Gibson in the final minute and change. The Panthers struggled at the line late. They had three 1-and-1 opportunities in the final 90 seconds and came away with just two points. Final stats Wright had another huge night for Joplin and led all scorers with 34 points while making 11 of 15 free throw shots. Renfro scored 7, Gibson had 5, Hafer had 4 and Hobbs Gooch and Fred Taylor each had 2. Joplin made 14 of 23 free throw attempts. Brendan Perry led the Panthers with 11. Ray-Pec made 6 of 8 free throws. What they’re saying“We started off 11-3 and we didn’t guard very well the second quarter. I thought we made some adjustments at half. We just told the kids to keep it simple, let the plays happen and then finish. There were a lot of times we weren’t finishing and going through contact. I think we held them to 19 points the second half. That’s huge against a good program like that with a bunch of shooters. I thought we adjusted well. It wasn’t the prettiest but we found a way to win. ”— Joplin head coachBronson Schaake“(Whit Hafer) can be a presence on both ends of the floor. I thought Terrance (Gibson) made some better energy plays in the second half. Cooper Williams guarded extremely well tonight and so did Fred (Taylor). Those guys we’re trying to bring a long. It’s a tough, gritty group. ”— Schaake“Good battle. I thought it was really, really physical. I thought they really tried to get after it and make it that way and it was a good early season test for us. We’ve got a lot of guys who aren’t used to that kind of game and I thought we stepped up and did some really good things. ”— Ray-Pec head coachScott JermainUp nextJoplin tangles with 3-0 Carthage at 4:30 p. m.

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Joplin juniors All Wright and Quin Renfro combined to score 45 points and the Eagles managed to fend off a pesky Rush team on Thursday night. The Eagles won 61-52 in the opening round of the 76th Carthage Invitational. Wright made five three pointers in the game and scored 16 points in the first half. Renfro picked up the slack in the second half, scoring 15 after the break. Joplin, now 2-1, advances to Friday’s semifinal round. The Eagles will take on Raymore-Peculiar at 7 p. m. in Carthage. The Panthers defeated Nevada 54-33 on Thursday. Rush is a home-school team out of the Springfield area. In the first halfJoplin didn’t score its first points until more than three minutes had elapsed, but then junior All Wright scored three baskets in a row, including two from three-point range. Rush (4-2) hung around, though, and led 13-12 with 40 seconds left in the first quarter. From that point on, however, Rush went six possessions without scoring and the Eagles led 21-13 following a free throw by Collis Jones with 3:58 left in the half. A corner 3 from Wright made it 28-19 minutes later, but Rush scored four points in the final 14 seconds to trail by five at halftime. In the second halfRush got as close as two points early in the third quarter after a three-point play. It was still a three-point game with 4:31 left in the quarter. A three pointer by Joplin’s Renfro gave the Eagles some breathing room at 37-31, then Whit Hafer grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to make it an 8-point game. Joplin led 43-33 after a Renfro layup. Rush again cut it to 5, but Joplin finished the third with a three pointer by Wright and another Renfro score to lead 48-38. Joplin’s lead was trimmed to 52-48 with 2:56 left in the game. Again, Wright and Renfro scored to keep Joplin ahead, and Rush was held scoreless on 5 of 6 possessions as the Eagles took a 61-50 lead in the final minute after two Hafer free throws. Final StatsWright led all scorers with 26 points and Renfro added 19. Hafer scored 6 and Terrance Gibson added 5. Joplin made 7 of 15 free throw attempts. Joe Grayes scored 19 for Rush, which made 10 of 12 free throws. Joplin won the turnover battle 17-11. What they’re saying“Starting off they played the 1-3-1 and we’ve got some bigs who can get in the paint, All can get in the paint. We did a good job of that in the first half and that kind of opened it up. But we’re going to get zoned so we’ve got to be able to knock down some outside shots and capitalize when they give it to us. ” — Joplin head coach Bronson Schaake. “We try to pride ourselves on the defensive end. We haven’t done well our first two games guarding but I thought tonight against a team that had a really good big player and four good shooters, we did a good job rotating. We had some moments of fatigue where we had a lapse but overall we were getting in the passing lanes and being aggressive. ” — Schaake. “All (Wright) got going in the first half and found a good rhythm and they had some other guys step up in the second half and knock down big shots when we were making a run at them. We had our opportunities and just didn’t get the job done. But great experience competing with Class 6 schools. Being a small homeschool program, getting opportunities to step on the court and go toe-to-toe with a Class 6 school is great experience for these guys. We actually played them in the summer and beat Joplin. We were pretty confident we could play with them coming in. We’ve got a lot of respect for them. I know how talented they are. At the end of the day they made more shots. ” — Rush coach Greg Ray. Up next Joplin takes on Ray-Pec at 7 p. m. Friday in the semifinal round. The loser will play for third place at 3 p. m. Saturday, with the championship set for 4:30 p. m. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — Residents could start seeing changes in two of the city’s busiest parks in a couple of months pending action by the Carthage City Council. The council’s Public Services Committee last month advanced two proposals for contracts with Park & Play Structures, a company based in Tennessee, to replace playground equipment in Municipal Park and Carter Park for a total of about $1. 4 million. The proposals will be considered by the council in January. The proposals would build new playgrounds with modern structures that will be accessible to most children, including those with limited mobility, in both parks. The city last month also hired Abi Almandinger, formerly the director of the Vision Carthage committee, to take over as director of parks and recreation. She succeeds Mark Peterson, who resigned in November. City Administrator Greg Dagnan said he’s excited to get the projects moving and see real change in the city’s parks. \"Certainly in the first half of 2023, we’ll see new playground structures going into Municipal Park and Carter Park,” Dagnan said. “That’s a very safe bet. The McCune-Brooks Hospital Trust gave us a little over $5 million for phase one and two, and it’s been awhile since they gave that to us, so I'm very excited that we’re going to move forward with this contract. ”Dagnan said the city went with Park & Play Structures because the company can offer a better price for playground equipment. The company \"can give us what’s called a state bid; they’re a state contractor,” Dagnan said. “We didn’t just randomly choose them; they get great references, they do a great job and they can provide us with a state bid, which will be less than other bidders could give. ”Dagnan said the city will spend approximately $871,000 on the new playground structures at Municipal Park, the city’s busiest and highest profile park, and $531,000 for the structures in Carter Park, probably the second-busiest park in the city. Steve Casada, a recreation consultant with Park & Play Structures, previously came to Carthage and described the proposals for Municipal and Carter parks. He described playground structures and devices that provide a variety of play opportunities to children of all ages and children who have to use mobility devices to help them get around. “It’s all part of that inclusion drive; we want children of all abilities playing,” Casada told the Public Services Committee last month. “As you go through and look at the design, we’ve also developed and added a lot of sensory elements to the playground for children of all different sensory challenges and things such as this. That is extremely important to design and keep that as part of your play area. ”He also described what he called sensory panels that make different sounds and are designed to allow children to play together no matter what their physical or other limitations might be. Dagnan said the council will consider the contracts for the playgrounds at the two parks in January while the Public Services Committee and city staff continue working on proposals for playgrounds at Kellogg Lake Park, Central Park and Griggs Park. He said construction could start as soon as February, with the existing playgrounds being removed to make room for the new structures. The new playgrounds could be ready for use by May. The city and committee also plan to work on improving the bathrooms at all five parks, Dagnan said. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — The Carthage Board of Education is considering whether to go to voters a second time in the April 2023 election to seek a bond issue to build a performing arts center on the high school campus. Superintendent Mark Baker said the proposed ballot language would keep the same debt service levy of 83 cents per $100 of assessed valuation and extend it for 20 years after the election through 2043, this time giving the district the capacity to borrow up to $26 million. Baker said the board will discuss the performing arts center bond issue again at its next meeting Jan. 16 at Pleasant Valley Elementary School. He said the district’s bonding consultant will be on hand to give more details on the district’s bonding capacity and the impact of a bond issue’s passage. The board has until Jan. 24 to approve the bond issue to get it on the April ballot. A bond issue for the same project received more “yes” votes than “no” votes in the August 2022 election, but it fell short of the 57. 1% supermajority needed to take on debt via a bond issue. That bond issue would have authorized the district to borrow up to $18 million by extending the levy through 2042, but Baker said the district’s state-regulated bonding capacity has changed. “Last year, we had $18 million available, without increasing the tax rate, for construction projects,” Baker said. “Due to our assessed valuation increasing and the board paying off part of the previous bonds during 2022, that allowed our bonding capacity to increase to $26 million. ”Baker said costs for the project have also increased due in part to inflation. He said the district found out in recent weeks that Carthage’s city building code would require it to build a tornado safe room in the building to the 1,250-seat capacity of the performing arts center. Carthage Public Works Director Zeb Carney confirmed that an updated International Codes Council building code was adopted by the city in June 2021. Baker said the district has a policy of building safe rooms in new schools but not in buildings meant for other purposes, so no safe room was included in the previous design of the performing arts center. “Anytime we’re building a new school, we will have a tornado safe room involved in the project,” Baker said. “However, other previous construction projects did not have to have tornado safe rooms. This was a surprise to us; however, it is ultimately a great thing for our students and staff. The city adopted this new code since the last time we built a building. ”Baker said the district is considering alternatives to integrate the safe room in the center. “We’re trying to think of anything that could save us money without substantially changing the entire project,” Baker said. “An idea might be to make the auditorium part of the PAC tornado safe room. To do that, we will probably have to eliminate the balcony to lower the height of the shelter and maybe make it deeper and a little bit wider. We’re looking at all options. ”Baker said the performing arts center is by far the largest construction project on the district’s plate at this time, but two other projects are also being discussed. He said the district needs to add four classrooms to its Early Childhood Center, a project estimated to cost $1. 2 million. A new baseball field on the high school campus has been discussed to replace the Carl Lewton Stadium at Municipal Park, a project with an estimated cost of $4 million at this time. “I explained again that we cannot afford all three projects,” Baker said. “I told the board on Monday our priority should be to remain focused on the PAC. We’ve discussed it with the community for years. That was the most important project in the last couple of years that was discussed. The focal point must remain on the performing arts center. ”The board on Monday also approved two new lists of naming rights opportunities for people interested in donating to the Early Childhood Center and the baseball field. “I needed the board to approve these so we could actually go out and start promoting the projects,” Baker said. “Last month, we approved the (performing arts center) naming rights, but in order to really promote the baseball field and early childhood projects, people need to know various naming right options if their goal is to have naming rights as part of the donation. Unfortunately, the Early Childhood Center has very few opportunities for naming rights when you’re only adding classrooms. ”\n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — The annual LaVerne Williams Children’s Christmas Party will be a bit brighter thanks to last weekend’s Steve Benjamin memorial concert, held at the Lighthouse by the Duke Mason Band. The band raised $1,100 and collected dozens of new toys to be given to the children who will attend the Christmas party at 9 a. m. Saturday at Carthage’s Memorial Hall. The party is hosted by the Carthage Police Department, and Chief Bill Hawkins was on hand on Sunday to thank Mason, his band and the crowd that donated the money and toys. “Duke and the band have been part of this Christmas party for, I’ve lost track of how many years,” Hawkins said. “I’m doing good to keep track of the actual number of Christmas parties there have been. I believe 47 is what we think it is. When you think about that, this tradition has been going on for 47 years and we still have an amazing turnout, we still have generous donations with the cash and toys back here. This party could not happen and would not happen without folks such as yourself. ”Hawkins spoke about the late LaVerne Williams, a longtime Carthage police detective for whom the party is named. Williams planned this party for more than 30 years and was involved in planning almost until the day he died, shortly before the 2010 Christmas party. “He was a true friend of mine,” Hawkins said. “I got hired at the police department in 1982. LaVerne was working there at that time. I’m the last remaining officer that worked with LaVerne Williams that’s still currently working in Carthage, and LaVerne truly was a great guy. ”Mason also talked about his memories of Williams. “I don’t know what year I met LaVerne, but he came to one of our shows and he came up and introduced himself and he was one of those people that as soon as you met him you were friends,” Mason said. “We got to be friends and he said, hey, would you ever want to come to a Christmas party we do for kids and maybe do a few Christmas songs? I said, sure, I’ll do that, a few kids hanging around, no big deal. I walked in and there were . . . kids everywhere. It was so much fun. ”It took three stages for Mason to raise that $1,100 at Sunday’s concert. People who attended the concert were asked to give either cash or a new toy at the door when they entered the concert. When party organizer Cheryle Finley counted the receipts from the door, it came out to $737. Mason said he was putting in $63 to make it an even $800, then he passed the hat around the room for a second offering that collected another $300. \n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. — With the retirement of Webb City High School football head coach John Roderique, after 26 years leading that program, Carthage’s Jon Guidie is now the winningest active head coach in the Central Ozark Conference, which is arguably the toughest conference in the state. Guidie is recognized as one of the more prominent figures in the history of the Carthage football program, and at the end of each season you can usually count on seeing the Carthage Tigers finish among the top teams in the state. This fall, the Tigers made their fourth Final Four appearance of the last six seasons, going 11-1 before losing to the Francis Howell Vikings in a Class 5 state semifinal at David Haffner Stadium. (Francis Howell went on to win the state title. )The Tigers were hoping for their second state championship in program history; their first was claimed in 2019 with a 27-21 overtime win against Jackson. Earlier this month, he was named Class 5 Coach of the Year by the Missouri State High School Activities Association. “I’ve been with Coach Guidie for six years now. He runs a first-class program, and he has been a great mentor for me personally. He demands excellence while preaching to do the right thing on and off the field,” said Ricky Nichols, who serves on Guidie’s coaching staff as the offensive coordinator. “Coach Guidie has built this program into one of the best in the state. He is one of the hardest working people I’ve ever been around. His career record and accomplishments speak for themselves. ”Clay Kinder, a senior football player, said, “Guidie is a great coach all-in-all, but I think he’s an even better person. He’s very good to us players and tells us he loves us every day. He’s just such a great mentor and drives us to want to be successful every day. ”BeginningsA 1990 graduate of Cherryvale High School in Southeast Kansas, he got some of his first experience while attending Emporia State University in 1993 as an assistant coach at Emporia High School. He also was an assistant coach at Lyndon High school in 1994 while student teaching. “My very first year in coaching I was going to college at Emporia State University, and I’ll never forget this. During one of my coaching classes, the high school football coach from Emporia High School was one of the guest speakers that day. After he came in and did his thing I just went down and introduced myself afterward. You know, I’m nobody at the time. I’m just a kid from a small school going to school. His name was Mike Lee, and this guy sat down with me, and we ended up talking for a little over an hour in the hallway outside of the classroom. “When speaking to me, at the end of that conversation he asked me if I would like to come be a part of his staff. So, I quit everything I was doing and at the time I was working two jobs. I mean I was so excited and so fired up and all this that I was able to get on that staff. Obviously that first year you’re going to learn a lot and I learned a lot of good things from coach Lee and that staff there. and to be honest . . . I still use some of those things today I got learning from them. We have some special teams’ stuff that I learned that year, which was 30 years ago, and we still use them. We even used some of it this year. That’s why that first year was a very important year for me, because of those things that I learned. ”“I also want to say that I had a coach — Nick Dawson was his name — and he was a coach at Lyndon High School right by Topeka there in Kansas and that next year after starting coaching at Emporia I was able to coach basketball at the high school under coach Dawson. At the time he was the winningest active coach in the state. I don’t know how I got lucky enough to cross my path with these guys, but he had over 600 wins and I was able to go in and learn from him as well. “And it’s not just basketball that was learned, but just so many things about life. Just things like how to treat people, how to practice the right way in the largest maturing period during these kids’ lives, and the right way of getting the community involved with support. I’m very fortunate to have been able to learn these things working with him. and again, I still use a lot of those principles here. You know, all these years later and we’re still doing a lot of those things that I learned back then. ”CarthageGuidie started coaching after college at Cherryvale, as an assistant coach from 1995-1997. He was head coach from 1998-2004. He accepted an offer to be the head coach at Carthage the next year. He said the the program had struggled before he arrived, but a previous coach, Doug Buckmaster, also helped turn it around. “I think there were several losing seasons with records like 2-8 type seasons. Coach (Doug) Buckmaster was the one there, though, when I took over and there were three to four other coaches prior to him. Buckmaster was there for two seasons. His first season the team went 5-5, then 9-1 the following season. . . . So, when I came in that next season in 2005 there were a lot of high expectations. ”Guidie talked about some of the steps he took to build the program. “ . . . There are 3 things that I brought in that we still do and use today. (They) are repetition, competition, and development in the weight room all season. The number of reps our kids get in practice is unbelievable. For example, our kids are getting 25-30 reps every practice. We run each play 15 times a day in practice before we actually go use it in competition. Competition is really big for us. I have no idea how they did it before my staff and I got here, but we wanted to be good-on-good every single day,” he said, meaning his best players were competing against his best players. “This might be unique to what other teams do, but during practices I put my defensive coordinator in charge of the scout defense and the offensive coordinator in charge of the scout offense because those guys understand how important it is for that particular group to be really good. It’s only going to make the other side better, and so through that I think we are able to get better and better each day and each week. ”Guidie also talked about offseason development. “What are you doing in the off-season to get these guys ready to compete at a very high level? . . . I think that, number one, just getting kids in that weight room and making them understand that just becoming a little bigger, a little faster or stronger, a little more duality for more speed, and more footwork are all a part of things that you can control. So, when we got here, we kind of hit the ground running, and you know obviously we only have the summer to get ready for that. But, after that first season we really made it a point to really develop these kids and now every season they are able to execute to their best ability mentally and physically. ”WinningAt Carthage, Guidie reached 100 career wins in 2016 (12th season at Carthage) after beating Willard at home 28-14 in the Class 5 District 5 Semifinal playoff game. The team’s record was 9-1 in the season after that win, bumping Guidie’s career record at Carthage High School to 100-35. He only had 1 losing season up to that point in the 12 seasons he had been there. Guide then reached 200 career wins (18th season at Carthage) after beating Republic at home 56-26 in the first game of the 2022 season this past year. Gina Guidie, his wife, has witnessed how much he cares about his players. “He communicates with them often through text to check on them to always make sure they’re okay. He has the seniors over to our house before school starts at the end of summer to eat, swim and talk about their goals, aspirations, and expectations for the upcoming season. It’s good for them to see him in an environment outside of the weight room and away from the football field. He also is very present as their weights class teacher. He never has and never will sit on the job because his weights classes and summer weights program are a huge part of their success. Last year, he had four consecutive classes without a break, so he stood, encouraged, and challenged kids for over four hours before he would go to his office to work on football, then finish his classes for the day. “He’s always been an overachiever and anything he does, he does it very well, because he’s not willing to settle for anything less than the best, which is what he always expects of himself. That’s one of the attributes I admire most about him. ”\n",

      "CARTHAGE, Mo. —The Carthage girls basketball team used a big run to overcome a double-digit deficit in the first half, but couldn’t hang on against visiting Nevada on Thursday night. The Tigers trailed by a dozen points in the second quarter, then went on a 16-3 run to take a lead in the third quarter before ultimately falling 55-49 in non-conference basketball action. Carthage fell to 5-2 with the loss, and Nevada improved to 6-2. In the first half:The visitors made five 3-pointers in the first half and limited Carthage to one field goal in the first seven-plus minutes of the game. A 3-pointer by Carthage sophomore Lexa Youngblood cut it to 14-6 at the end of the first, but Nevada led 25-13 halfway through the second after Clara Swearingen made one of her four 3-pointers in the game. That’s when the Tigers went on their run, and sophomore Lauren Choate played a big part in it. She scored 10 points in the quarter and made two free throws, a 3-pointer and a field goal to help cut it to 27-20 by halftime. Nevada was scoreless the final 4:23 of the half. In the second half:Senior Kianna Yates opened the scoring with a 3 and added a layup on the next possession. Two free throws by Youngblood made it 28-27, and Carthage took its first lead when she scored underneath the basket with 6:11 left in the third. It was 32-30 Carthage after Yates connected on another 3, but Nevada’s Maddy Majors scored six-straight points and Swearingen added a pull-up jumper to lead 38-32. A 3-pointer by Nevada’s Kara Phillips made it 45-37 at the end of three. Carthage stayed within striking distance in the fourth and trailed 49-47 after two free throws by Choate with 2:23 remaining. Swearingen again scored from three-point range, but Carthage senior Landry Cochran scored with 50 seconds left to keep it a three-point game. Nevada then threw the ball away on an inbounds attempt with 37 seconds on the clock, but Carthage coughed it up when Caylee Holcomb intercepted a pass. Majors added three free throws in the final 20 seconds to seal it. Final stats:Choate led Carthage with 17 points, Yates added 12 and Youngblood scored 10. Cochran had 6 and sophomore Zye Clark scored 4. The Tigers made 8 of 15 free throw attempts. Nevada’s Swearingen had a game-high 20 points and Majors added 16. The visitors didn’t attempt a free throw in the first half and made 8 of 10 in the second. What they’re saying:“I thought we had great energy for all 32 minutes. We did not shoot the ball well in that first quarter and dug ourselves that hole. I was proud of Lauren Choate for getting hot in the second quarter and making that run happen for us. The girls feed off her energy when she’s shooting three’s and knocking them down and we can set up in whatever defense we’re running, so I’m happy with that part. Defensively, too many miscues. Not properly picking up their best player or leaving their second-best player open so we’ve got to work on a few of those things. Probably one of my initial concerns is we haven’t played a lot of competition yet and maybe we had a false sense of ourselves. So Nevada showed us our flaws and we’ve got some things we’ll work on and get better at for the Pink and White tournament. ”– Carthage head coachScott Moore“We didn’t really get back on defense very well in their transition after a make or miss. I thought that whenever they started chipping away at that 12-point lead but then it got better in the second half. We battled through some adversity – some foul trouble, some hand checks, but overall we continued to play as a team and took care of the basketball. Down the stretch we were able to knock down the shots and the free throws, too. ”– Nevada head coachBlake HowarthUp nextCarthage returns to action Dec. 27-30 in the Pink & White Lady Basketball Classic at Drury University in Springfield.

      "Congratulations to John Roderique. The Webb City head football coach announced he is retiring this week after one of the greatest runs of any coach in Missouri history. He won more than 300 games and led Webb City to 13 state titles. He never had a losing season. The Cardinals went to the playoffs 23 times under his leadership, and won 22 straight district championships. He was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame last year, and we remember what he had to say and how he credited others with his success. “Obviously you have to have good kids who buy in, and good parents,” Roderique told us at that time. “We’ve had some outstanding coaches too. I’ve been blessed with staffs that everybody is on the same page. And we’ve had great administrative support. ”He also shared credit with his wife, Heather. “She’s the one who deserves a gold star . . . She’s been fantastic. Not every one is meant to be a coach’s wife. She does that as well as anybody. ”He also told us: “The wins and the state championships and the records we’ve had . . . It’s very humbling, very flattering. Nobody does anything on their own. I think about the coaches I played for, the teammates I had in college, the players and coaches I’ve worked with here. That’s what it’s really about, not the wins or losses but about the people you meet along the way. ”Seneca Athletics Director Rich Adkins, who was a senior on Roderique’s 1997 team, and later served as an assistant coach on his staff from 2009-11, told us Roderique’s success was due in part to his relationships with people. “He knows every kid, he knows every coach’s spouse’s name, their kid’s names, and he does a good job with people and building those relationships to where these kids and these community members want to be a part of it, they want to play for him and do whatever they can. ”Humility . . . sharing the glory . . . focusing a program on relationships — we can all learn from that. We thank Roderique for the exciting run over the last 26 seasons and wish him well in the future. \n",

      "Construction of the new Dover Hill Elementary School continues to be on track for completion in less than a month, the Joplin Board of Education was told Tuesday. The school is about 92% finished, with the completion date still scheduled for Dec. 16, said Aaron Hight, senior project manager with Crossland Construction Co. Dover Hill teachers and staff expect to begin moving in Dec. 10, he said. “We are at the finish line,” he told the board. Work currently in progress includes landscaping and the planting of trees and installation of sod, Hight said. That work has been challenged by recent weather changes, from hot and dry to cold and wet. “Obviously, it’s kind of hard to landscape when it’s wet out there, but we’re battling through it,” he said. Panels also are going up on the exterior canopy, and punch-list work — a final check of items to be finished — will continue through November and into early December for the exterior, the roof, the commons and kitchen areas, and the outdoor areas, Hight said. Inside, the school is popping with color; hallways and classrooms have been painted in bright orange, yellow, blue, red and other colors. Hight said a temporary occupancy permit has been issued for Dover Hill, with the final permit expected in early December. The school, which is being paid for through a $25 million bond issue approved by voters in 2020, will house students and staff from Columbia and West Central schools, two of the oldest buildings in the Joplin School District. Classes will begin there when the district resumes classes in January after the holiday break. “We’re getting close,” Superintendent Kerry Sachetta said at Tuesday’s board meeting. “Several of us have been in the building several times in the last several days, and there are changes every time you go. ”\n",

      "Daniel has been at Immanuel Lutheran Church in Joplin for about a month, and he’s already receiving Christmas mail. He recently received a card and bandanna from Samson, the comfort dog at Zion Lutheran Church in Marengo, Illinois. “When you’re the new dog, you get lots of mail,” Jason Glaskey, minister to youth and families at Immanuel Lutheran and a comfort dog handler, said as he opened the envelope with a chuckle. Daniel is the new comfort dog at Immanuel Lutheran Church in Joplin. He continues a ministry that was started in 2011 as the church sought to offer emotional support to the community in the wake of that year’s tornado. Immanuel is letting the community know Daniel has arrived and their team has been fully certified. They’re looking forward to building relationships and meeting people. “It’s been rewarding,” Glasky said, “when I meet people and they say, ‘Oh, I remember the other comfort dogs; this is the new one?’ They’ve been expecting and waiting for this dog to come to town. ”The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod runs the comfort dog ministry through Lutheran Church Charities and is based in Chicago. Launch of programImmanuel’s comfort dog ministry started in the summer of 2011 after comfort dogs visited Joplin from Chicago, rotating two or three dogs a week at the church’s relief center. Before the tornado, the church had never heard of Lutheran comfort dogs and their mission of emotional and physical support. The church and Joplin both got to know the emotional support dogs during the recovery process. “By the end of the summer, we had fallen in love,” Glaskey said. “We had seen the effectiveness and realized the need for the continued support. ”At the time, comfort dogs Louie and Jackson had just completed their training and were assigned to Immanuel Lutheran Church and Martin Luther School. The ministry used the dogs in a variety of ways, both locally and nationally, as they helped people who had gone through disasters. In addition to helping area residents with post-tornado support, they also visited Newtown, Connecticut, after the Sandy Hook Elementary shootings in 2013 and Las Vegas in 2017 after the mass shooting at a music festival. “We don’t just respond to disasters, though,” Glaskey said. “Typical days are much lighter, much happier, most of the time. We get to go to nursing homes and visit the residents there. We get invited into schools to visit with classrooms. The people of Joplin will find us at community events, the park or the mall going for walks. We like to spread smiles and build relationships with people. ”The ministry with Louie and Jackson came to an end when the dogs aged toward retirement. Jackson died in 2019, followed by Louie in 2021. But even as Louie approached retirement, the church was already thinking about a new comfort dog. It takes a lot of funding and volunteers to run the ministry, and they started preparing for the long process of getting a dog. Daniel is almost 2 years old; his birthday is coming up on Jan. 15. The light-brown golden retriever has been raised since he was a puppy to be a comfort dog by Lutheran Church Charities. He’s received more than 2,000 hours of training. Daniel also has two brothers who are also comfort dogs, one in Nebraska and one approaching placement. “Daniel is a really smart dog, very well trained,” Glaskey said. “We were very impressed when we met him for the first time. Comfort dogs need to be calm in stressful places, they need to be still so they can be petted and they need to be attentive to people around them. He really enjoys meeting people, and he’s really good at helping us to help people. ”Daniel’s business cardEvery comfort dog has a business card with its photo, a popular collector’s item when meeting a dog. Daniel actually has three cards: one as a puppy, one from when he was in service and now one as an official service dog. His current card features his home church, social media channels (follow the pup @LCCK9Daniel on Instagram) and a verse. Daniel’s verse is, appropriately, Daniel 12:3: “Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever. ”Both dogs and their handlers are trained to be good listeners. They care for the needs of the community, and when appropriate, pray with them, share scripture and offer faithful encouragement. “There are so many people we meet every week who are not tied to a church, but they get to meet Daniel the comfort dog,” Glaskey said. “They get to experience the mercy and compassion that a comfort dog can lead people toward. ”Comfort dog handlers are all volunteers, screened by Lutheran Church Charities. Daniel’s handlers went to Chicago for three eight-hour days of training. They then came home with Daniel and trained for five to six more weeks while sending videos to Chicago for critiques. Final evaluations with a trainer in person completed the process to become certified handlers. Jennifer Jankowski, comfort dog handler and science club teacher at Martin Luther School, said that when out in public, Daniel is often greeted by smiles and pats. She said Daniel makes everybody a little lighter the day that he sees them. “I’ve worked with dogs for many years, and they’re always there,” Jankowski said. “They’re always your friend. You can pour out your soul to a dog and you know it’s not leaving that dog. It’s that comfort of having something you can hold, touch and pet. If you need to cry in his fur, he’s OK with that. ”‘Reach out to us’Immanuel’s comfort dog ministry is self-funded, and there is never a charge for what they do. The ministry accepts donations to the comfort dog travel fund so that they can be ready to go if called upon. People interested in Daniel can connect through immanueljoplin. com/comfortdogs or through Daniel’s Facebook or Instagram pages. At this stage of their ministry, Glaskey said they are reestablishing relationships in the community and ready to start adding to Daniel’s social calendar. “Another thing about our ministry is that we don’t invite ourselves,” Glaskey said. “We wait to be invited. If anyone out there knows a teacher or a school we should visit, reach out to us. If anyone has a hospital floor or nursing home that Daniel should visit, we are hoping people will call and invite us. ”\n",

      "Earlier this month, during a Joplin City Council discussion about homelessness, the comment was made:“We seem to spend a ton of time and a ton of money when I see other communities grab the bulls by the horns and starting doing something. ”The remark came in the context of a proposal to hire a consultant to study the issue and whether this was a prudent use of resources. “To throw more money on something that should be obvious is kind of frustrating,” another said. But those comments ended up making the case for a consultant. Joplin has taken the bull by horns. We have two dozen agencies that work together as the Homeless Coalition conducting annual counts, linking up homeless people with resources and that work aggressively to solve the problem using a number of strategies and philosophies. The solution isn’t always obvious, either. “For the size of our area, we have a lot of homeless services — Souls Harbor, Watered Gardens, Washington Family Hope Center, the Carthage Crisis Center — and I think it draws more homeless folks here,” Robin Smith, assistant community development director with the Economic Security Corp. who also chairs the homeless coalition, told us not long ago. “I think it’s a bigger problem than people realize because a majority of homeless folks are pretty hidden. ”Homelessness and underlying causes such as mental illness and substance abuse seem to be a long-term challenge that won’t be solved simply by housing, and it would helpful to have an outside expert look into whether we have any social and economic conditions that are unique to our area. We support bringing in an outside analysis but have a few questions we want them to address too:1. Our homeless counts typically show between 200 and 300 homeless, both housed in area shelters and unhoused. Is that high for any area of our size?2. How much does the emphasis on services contribute to the challenge? Or does it?3. Meanwhile, too many people are only a paycheck away from falling into homelessness. What economic and social service steps do we need to take in the community to prevent that before it happens?4. How much of this is a perception problem created by panhandlers, who may or may not be homeless?5. For the effort, it is always helpful to know if there are gaps in our existing services and whether there is duplication of services. Finding out what we don’t need to be doing is as important as knowing what we should be doing. Residents have identified homelessness as one of their priorities, and to their credit, city officials are listening and working to move forward. Ultimately, a majority of the council supported hiring a consultant, which seems to us a reasonable step in addressing a complicated problem. \n",

      "Employees of Contract Freighters Inc. continued a tradition Thursday with the 29th annual Truckload of Treasures event at the 15th Street Walmart in Joplin. In addition to shopping for about 300 children, senior citizens and families as part of the Salvation Army’s Angel Tree program, CFI employees gave donations of $1,600 each to a number of community service agencies in Joplin during a ceremony at the store. The Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Four States was one of those agencies. Annette Thurston, executive director of RMH, said the money will go to help families who are forced to remain away from home because they have a loved one in a local hospital. “I think what speaks to the meaning more than anything is when you place yourself in the shoes of a parent with a seriously ill child and you would typically be home with your own tree in your own house celebrating Christmas,” Thurston said. “This $1,600 provides us with the opportunity to bring that normalcy, that warmth, that glow and the joy of the holiday season within our doors. Families don’t have to think about or worry about where they’re going to shop because they can shop under the tree. ”Rhonda Gorham, executive director at one of the other recipient agencies, the Boys & Girls Club of Southwest Missouri, said the donation will be put to good use by her group. “Donations, especially at this time of the year, the end of the year, are very important for our organization,” she said. “It doesn’t matter how small or how large; it all adds up. We serve over 600 kids a day, and it takes a lot to feed them and run programs. We keep our membership fees down very low, so everything we get is going back to support the kids. ”Other agencies receiving checks at CFI’s Truckload of Treasures event were the Area Agency on Aging, Camp Quality, Children’s Haven, Disabled American Veterans Chapter 52, and the Joplin Humane Society. CFI President Greg Orr said CFI associates raised $41,000 for all aspects of the annual effort, pushing the amount donated over the past 29 years to more than $1 million. “Our employees are the ones that are doing this,” Orr said. “Not only the shopping, but they’re the ones who donated the money, so . . . doing this for 29 years consecutively is a very big deal, and we’re very proud of our people for being able to do this. ”Connie Andrews, executive director of the Joplin Humane Society, said the donations are helping some of Joplin’s homeless four-legged residents. “CFI has been an amazing supporter of the Joplin Humane Society for years, and they have always come out and donated to help with adoptions, to donate for food, for medical supplies,” Andrews said. “It’s Christmastime, and there are a lot of pets at this shelter that don’t have a home. They’re living in a kennel. They don’t have their own family or their own couch to lay on. ”Company employees shopped for 300 children, older residents and families who applied for assistance through the Salvation Army’s Angel Tree program. Lt. Jennifer Norris, with the Salvation Army of Jasper and Newton Counties, said the CFI effort is a big boost for that program. “CFI has been doing this shopping for Angel Tree for 29 years,” Norris said. “There are some seniors but mainly children. That’s great. Our list is over 850 people, so that’s a big chunk at them. I’ve been working at the register helping them to bag up gifts that they’re buying for the angels. It’s just great. ”Barbara Haslip, senior manager of finance at CFI, said she shopped for four people Thursday. “They do give you a little bit of a clue with a wish list, and you go based on what their interests are and their age and gender,” Haslip said. “It’s a wonderful opportunity. It was exciting to be able to do it again. With COVID and stuff, we haven’t been able to do all of this, but the employees really love to be able to give back to their community. ”\n",

      "From Staff Reportssports@joplinglobe. comCarthage boys basketball coach Nathan Morris answers five questions related to his sports career:Q: You played football at Coffeyville Community College and then Pittsburg State. How did you get into coaching basketball?A: I’ve always loved basketball and football but was lucky enough to continue playing football throughout college. Once I was hired at Carthage, I immediately reached out to Steve Ray to see if I could join his staff. Honestly, I expected to pursue moving up through the football ranks — I coached at CHS for seven years — but I immediately gravitated towards the basketball side. Q: What’s your coaching philosophy and preferred style of play when it comes to basketball?A: I played under a motion offense and man-to-man defense coach and that was mainly what we were under Coach Ray, so I feel like that is ingrained into me. I like to see the game moving at a quick tempo with kids that play extremely hard. We have had to play that way most of the time I’ve been in Carthage due to our lack of size. It can be really fun to coach and watch. Q: What’s the most memorable game you’ve been a part of as a player or coach?A: As a player, the experience at CCC to play a bowl game at Georgia Military College, Utah University, and on the base of Air Force were all pretty cool opportunities. Along with that, playing against Northwest Missouri State two times at the Arrowhead Classic was extremely memorable. As a coach, it doesn’t get much better than my first year as a head coach on senior night against Branson in 2019. Alex Martini scored his 1,000th point and Taris Jackson hit a half court buzzer beater to win the game. Pretty cool moment involving two of our five seniors from that year. Q: The Central Ozark Conference gets a lot of attention for football — what’s it like as a basketball conference?A: For all the praise that football gets in our area, we feel as though basketball should be at the same level if not higher. There is some big-time basketball played in SWMO and the entire state, for that matter. There should be more kids leaving this area, getting a chance to play college basketball. Obviously Nixa, Ozark and Republic are traditionally state ranked and near the top of the COC, however the west side of our conference has closed that gap. Joplin, Webb and Carthage have been knocking on the door to land in the top 2-3 teams the past four to five years. Q: Besides Carthage, what’s your favorite gymnasium in the area?A: Neosho High School is my favorite gym in our area. I love how loud it can get in there, as well as the beautiful wood rafters/ceiling in there. As you go further east, I like Republic’s gym a lot, as it has a fieldhouse look to it and usually a good atmosphere. \n",

      "Glenda Austin has played dozens — maybe hundreds — of pianos in classrooms and performance halls around the country. The new Steinway concert grand piano at the Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex is one of the better ones, she said, with beautiful action on the keys and a responsive sound. “It practically plays itself,” she said. “I can tell you, as many other pianists can, that all pianos do not feel the same,” Austin said. “Some feel much better to play . . . and there are definitely pianos I have played before that I don’t care to play, where it seems like it takes more effort on my part. This (Steinway) feels very comfortable. ”Austin will perform on that piano Saturday in a concert that marks the opening of an expanded concert season at the newly opened Cornell Complex. Presented by Connect2Culture, Austin will play a large collection of holiday favorites, such as “We Need a Little Christmas” and “What Child is This?”Austin has more than 50 years of experience behind the 88 keys — as well as the multitudes behind organs. The lifelong pianist is also a teacher, composer and clinician who has reached thousands upon thousands of students through her works, instruction or support as an accompanist. A former teacher with the Joplin School District, she currently teaches at College Heights Christian School and is also a choral accompanist for Missouri Southern State University. As a composer, she works for the Willis Music Co. and Hal Leonard. As a church pianist, she has played numerous preludes and other special works for services. She has also played countless parties, banquets and other events. But it has been years since she has been the featured performer in a program. She is excited, however, about the chance. Playing holiday music on a new instrument in a new performance hall was an opportunity she seized. “When I was asked to do this program, I jumped on it,” Austin said. “I love holiday music, and I wanted to be in that space. I knew this opportunity would be an enjoyable evening for me, and I hope it’s just as enjoyable for the audience. ”As nice as that Steinway is, it’s not enough to sway her from the Steinway baby grand piano at her home. Austin said she and her husband, David, have discussed getting a bigger piano in the past. But she is too attached to the baby grand at home, she said. It’s an instrument that can be seen at least once a week — Austin over the last few years has become active on Facebook and YouTube, playing mini-concerts and drawing hundreds of listeners from around the world. At the onset of the pandemic, she noted how other musicians started sharing small solo concerts. Now she takes song and hymn requests, and plays them for people who log in weekly. “I had never done that before, but I had seen some of my friends try it,” Austin said. “I started experimenting in my own living room, and they became regular Facebook Live videos. ”\n",

      "Head coach John Blankenship apparently had all the right words at halftime. The College Heights girls basketball team, which led 23-15 after two quarters, opened the second half on a 17-0 run and rolled to a 56-27 victory against visiting Purdy on Monday night in Joplin. The Class 2 No. 5 Cougars improved to 3-2 with the win, while Purdy dropped to 0-6. In the first halfCollege Heights took a 7-1 lead to start the game but couldn’t put the Eagles away. It was 11-9 after the first quarter, and the Cougars found themselves trailing in the second when Purdy’s Courtney Patterson scored to make it 13-12 at the 6:02 mark. The Eagles were scoreless on their next 11 possessions, though, with six turnovers. Maddy Colin grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to give the Cougars a 14-13 lead, and they never trailed again. She led the team with seven points before half. Neither team shot well from the free throw line in the first half. College Heights made 3 of 10 attempts, and Purdy made 5 of 15. In the second halfAgain, Purdy went 11-straight possessions without scoring and committed five more turnovers during the stretch. For College Heights, Colin and Lauren Ukena combined to make three baskets on three possessions. Molly Long rebounded her own miss and scored. Libby Fanning had five points. Six different cougars scored. and that was just in the third quarter. When Fanning scored at the 3:36 mark, College Heights led 40-15 and the game was all but over.

Fanning added 8 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks. Molly Long had 11 rebounds and six steals. Kinley Marsh had three blocks. What they’re saying“We had a little talk at halftime for sure. Our defensive intensity wasn’t where it needed to be in the first half. Part of that was due to a little bit of foul trouble. We just weren’t moving our feet on the press, reaching too much. We had a little discussion about that at halftime and they responded well. ”— College Heightscoach John Blankenship“Our team identity is our defense and our transition game. We get after it on defense and get some steals, it leads to our transition game and getting some high-percentage shots. We had some good looks in the first half but we were 25% from the floor in the first half. We picked that up, of course, in the second half. You start knocking down shots, it builds your intensity on defense a little bit. We saw a drastic transition in our defense the second half. ”— Blankenship“We played hard in the first half. We got their best player in some foul trouble in the first half, which allowed us to stay in it. Right now, with a lot of injuries going on, we just kind of ran out of legs in the second half. They went on a run we just couldn’t recover from. That’s a good ball team and they started making a lot of those shots they were missing in the first half. Some defensive plays we were not hustling back on. Always things we can work on. ”— Purdy coach Drew Williams Up next: College Heights hosts New Covenant Academy at 6 p. m. Friday.

      "In this weekly feature, we put five questions before someone in the community. Today, we chat with Chelsea Conley, development director of Lafayette House. 1. In what ways does Lafayette House celebrate the holiday season and make it special for clients?Although our missions are heavy, we want our clients to feel safe and joyful here. Lafayette House serves adults, children and families experiencing domestic violence, sexual assault or substance use disorders throughout Southwest Missouri. To help create a festive environment for not only our clients, but our staff as well, we’ve hung decorations throughout our building and scheduled various “extra” activities. To top off the holiday season, Santa will make a special appearance on Christmas morning to bring gifts to all clients who are in residency or shelter. 2. How many people does Lafayette House serve?We serve over 1,000 individuals each year. When it comes to services for domestic violence/sexual assault, we serve men, women and their children. Those services range from a 24-hour hotline, emergency shelter, case management, counseling and a number of other supportive services. For substance use disorders, our residential program is geared toward women. We are a families-first program, with a priority population of pregnant women or women who recently gave birth. Through treatment courts and nonresidential services, we can serve men and women. 3. What is Lafayette House’s Christmas Shop?Our Christmas Shop is open to any current Lafayette House client. The Christmas Shop is an opportunity for our clients and their minor children to shop for their loved ones, free of charge. 4. What toys and items are needed at Lafayette House for Christmas this year?We are grateful that several organizations and businesses chose to contribute to our Christmas Shop this year. We find that our largest donations are typically children’s toys. We would love to provide a wider variety of teen gifts and also adult gifts. Having adult gifts allows our clients’ children the opportunity to give to their parents, which is also very special. 5. How can people donate to the Christmas Shop or to Lafayette House?An easy way someone can donate is through our Amazon Christmas wish list. This allows the gifts to be delivered directly to us and is generally quick shipping. Gift cards to Amazon, Walmart and Target are also fantastic because then we have the opportunity to purchase specific items that we are missing within the Christmas Shop. To see our Amazon wish list, visit https://a. co/1obJdF4. \n",

      "In this weekly feature, we put five questions before someone in the community. Today, we chat with Emily Frankoski, of Connect2Culture, and Heather Lesmeister, of Spiva Center for the Arts. 1. How did the first month go after the Harry M. Cornell Arts & Entertainment Complex opened in November?The first month has been a whirlwind of activity! The building’s opening was met with such excitement from the Joplin community and beyond. Among the multitude of events held within the complex since November, Connect2Culture has hosted three performances, one with Pro Musica and two as part of its greatly expanded 2022-2023 performance season. Additionally, George A. Spiva Center for the Arts has three exciting exhibits on display, including its 75th annual membership show and a collection of 91 lithographs from Thomas Hart Benton, and has held many classes already. Local organizations, like Heartland Opera Theatre and the Joplin Area Piano Teachers’ Association, as well as businesses like Sign Designs have already made use of the complex’s available spaces, hosting performances, recitals and meetings within the building. 2. Have you experienced any challenges or learned anything new since opening?We’re definitely still learning about our space and how it should be run. Blueprints and meetings can only take you so far — the real thing provides so many opportunities to learn and grow. We are also learning more about each other’s organizations. Having existed separately for so long, coming together under one roof was uncharted territory. Luckily, both the Spiva and C2C teams mesh well together and, in the spirit of camaraderie and teamwork, have begun working together to ensure the building operates smoothly. 3. Why is the Cornell Complex needed in the Joplin community?Joplin has no other community space like the Cornell Complex. Its state-of-the-art galleries, operated by Spiva, are specially equipped to meet Smithsonian standards for collection loans. This means that high-quality exhibits you would expect to see in larger cities can be displayed here. The building’s Beshore Performance Hall and Leggett & Platt Green amphitheater fill the void of intentional performance spaces in Joplin. Our community can experience world-class performing arts as C2C presents national touring shows alongside local or regional talent. Everything the complex has to offer is designed to draw the community in so that they can experience, learn about and develop a passion for visual and performing arts. As we like to say, art is for everyone — and the Cornell Complex ensures that statement remains true. 4. What type of feedback have you received from the public about the Cornell Complex?We have been overwhelmed with the community’s response to the building. Each day, the complex welcomes a steady stream of visitors, some of them first-time guests, others who have been regulars since the building first opened. No matter which category they fall into, patrons have repeatedly told our staff how the complex met or exceeded their expectations and how proud they are of Joplin. Their excitement and gratitude for this space is consistent. The same can be said for our opening celebration. Months of planning went into the public opening and, in the end, the abundance of positive feedback made our efforts worthwhile. Families, couples, friends and out-of-town guests toured the facility, enjoyed live performances from local organizations, viewed fantastic art exhibits, met larger-than-life puppets and became acquainted with Joplin’s new home for the arts. 5. What are you looking forward to during the Cornell Complex’s first full year of operation?We are looking forward to getting into the swing of things, normalizing operations and making the Cornell Complex a common gathering place for area residents and a must-see stop for visitors. Between our two organizations, and many other arts organizations who are sure to utilize the available space, we believe we can make it happen!C2C has many upcoming shows in the first quarter of the year. In January, its new Ignite Series kicks off with \"Call of the Wild: Illustrated Edition\" on Jan. 21 and Mad River Theatre Works' production of \"Freedom Flight\" on Jan. 28. In February, the Ignite Series continues with the Grammy-winning hip hop sensation The Secret Agency, and award-winning pianist Steven Spooner shares a free Corley Spotlight performance. The Curtains Up Series returns on Feb. 22, with the highly anticipated Aquila Theatre in Jane Austen’s \"Pride and Prejudice. \" A full list of upcoming C2C performances can be found at connect2culture. org. Similarly, Spiva has plenty of exhibits and classes in store for the beginning of 2023. \"Thomas Hart Benton: The Complete Editioned Lithographs\" will continue to be displayed in the Four States Gallery through March 4. \"The Thread That Connects\" by multimedia artist Holly Wilson will open in the Freeman Health System Main Gallery on Jan. 13 and will be up through March 4. At the center, a collection of paintings by late Joplin artist Robert Higgs will be exhibited in the Harry M. Cornell Permanent Collection Gallery from Jan. 28 to Feb. 25. Classes in glass, beaded jewelry, life drawing, woodburning, painting, pastels, plaster, photography and more will be offered in January and February.

We look to start another house next month, and we’re planning the rest of our 2023 builds. 3. What does Joplin Habitat look forward to in 2023?We will continue to try new ways to serve low-income families and large housing needs that face us. We look to build more multifamily houses, rehab more homes, provide small to significant home repairs to homeowners in need and expand our ReStore to provide a continuous variety of items sold at discounted prices. The more we build, the more people who shop at the ReStore. With more partners, we’ll be able to help more people in need of better housing. 4. When can we expect to see Joplin Habitat’s next completed project?We have four homes currently under construction that we are estimating will be done in January and February. We are planning our next Veteran Build, and we look to begin that in May. 5. Why should homeowners in need consider asking Joplin Habitat for assistance?We look to be an organization that can help in many different ways. Our ReStore is open to everyone, and you can find great products and great deals. Our housing programs are income-based. However, our light, exterior repair program called A Brush With Kindness is for those that just need some light work on the outside of their home. The most important aspect of this program is that we are a service to those who can no longer do things at their house that they once did. Most often, we do not want to be in positions of need, and many do not want to be bothersome to others. However, life presents moments where the once easy has become difficult. A Brush With Kindness brings together volunteers with Habitat who want to help do some outside work for people that have come to face physical difficulties. Whether the need is great or small, think of us as a place that is always looking to do its best to be a service to others. \n",

      "It came as a shock when longtime Webb City football coach John Roderique announced last week he plans to retire at the end of the school year after 26 seasons with the Cardinals. Not because the decision was entirely unexpected, but because it’s so hard to envision the Cardinals program without Roderique at the helm. It certainly shakes up the football landscape in Southwest Missouri, even as everyone waits to find out who will lead Webb City going forward. The numbers are worth repeating: 315 wins and just 34 losses. Thirteen state championships (in 15 appearances). In those 26 seasons, the Cardinals made the state semifinals or further an astounding 20 times. He’s already been inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. Of course, the numbers don’t tell the whole story. Roderique would be the first to credit all the assistant coaches throughout the years and the hundreds of players who’ve made it happen on the field. And I’ve seen a common sentiment shared often in the last week: As good a coach as he’s been, he’s an even better person. All those wins are impressive, but they don’t speak to the positive impacts on players and people. His Webb City coaching career ended with a 30-21 loss to Republic in district play last month. It snapped the Cardinals’ streak of 22-straight district titles, and was Republic’s first win ever (in 25 tries) against Webb City. ‘What do you say?’I’ve been thinking lately about Roderique’s comments to reporters after that game, standing in the south end zone at Cardinal Stadium with his family nearby. He was humble and spoke about the big picture. “Just told them we loved them and we’re proud of them,” he said. “What do you say? We didn’t get it done today. That really starts with me as a head football coach not having them ready. ”“I told them before the game — this is a game,” he said. “We make a lot of comparisons to what life is but you’re going to have days like this. ”And: “We all feel bad. If it didn’t hurt when you lose, it dang sure wouldn’t feel great when you win. ”Best teams? A question I’ve heard this week is the inevitable, “What’s the best team they’ve had?”It’s an impossible question to answer — and not just because there are well over a dozen to choose from. But I’ve got some thoughts and just for fun decided to spend way too much time doing some math. Looking back over those 26 seasons — and I should note that Webb City had some dominant, championship-winning teams even before Roderique’s tenure — the first thing that struck me was just how remarkably consistent the program has been. The Cardinals averaged at least 30 points per game in 24 of those 26 seasons (and 40+ in 10 seasons). and they allowed, on average, fewer than 20 points per game in 24 of those seasons (and 10 points or less in 11 seasons). That’s a well-above-average to great offense and well-above-average to great defense virtually every single year for two-and-a-half decades. The two highest-scoring seasons were 2012 (45 points per game) and 2013 (45. 1). The Cardinals were 29-1 with two titles in the span. The 2012 squad featured John Roderique, the coach’s son, at quarterback; Phoenix Johnson at running back; Kohl Slaughter at tight end; Seth Watkins on the offensive line; and Alex Easley at kicker. All were first team All-State picks. Running back Trey Parra and offensive linemen Jordan Green, James Fowler and Tony Carranco were offensive All-State selections in 2013. Webb City’s fewest points allowed was in 2005, when they gave up just 6. 8 per game. The defense posted six shutouts in 11 games and didn’t allow a point until week five, then followed that up with two more shutouts. They allowed just 20 points in their first eight games. It was a 10-1 season that ended in the quarterfinals. That team featured All-State selections Cody Gordon at linebacker and Marty Rodgers in the secondary. Webb City also had six shutouts in the undefeated 2000 season while allowing 7. 8 points per game and six more in the 14-1 2019 season — including a 35-0 win in the semifinals and a 48-0 win in the championship. Linebacker B. J. Scofield was a first team All-State pick in 2000, and defensive lineman Trent Thompson, linebackers Sergio Perez and Ruben Lenker, and defensive backs Treghan Parker and Gavin Surber were All-State selections in 2019. In those 26 seasons, Webb City held opponents scoreless 68 times. In terms of margin of victory, the top two teams were the 2012 squad, which won by an average of 35. 6 points, and the 2014 team, which won by an average of 35. 4. Both went 15-0. It’s also worth noting that the Cardinals don’t hesitate to get backups on the field when a game is out of reach in the second half. \n",

      "It has been eight years since the Neosho girls basketball team won its Holiday Classic tournament. The Wildcats will get a chance to do it again on Friday. Neosho limited Memphis Whitehaven to single digits in each of the first two quarters en route to a 58-44 win on Thursday afternoon and will take on defending champion Fort Smith Northside at 3:30 p. m. Friday at the high school. The Wildcats (7-4) outscored Whitehaven by 20 in the paint and held a 40-30 rebounding advantage. Karlee Ellick powered Neosho with 24 points, eight rebounds and three blocks, Reagan McInturff scored 13 points and had eight rebounds and Beclynn Garrett added 12 points and seven rebounds. Northside was a 58-32 winner against St. Joseph Lafayette. \n",

      "It was a sluggish start to the game on Wednesday night inside the middle school gymnasium at Diamond. McAuley (1-2) boys met Diamond (0-2) for a semifinal match-up on the consolation side of the bracket in the Gem City Classic. After pulling away from the Wildcats in the third quarter, the Warriors went on to win 42-31. After being all tied up at 14 going into the break, McAuley got it going on offense in the second half. The Warriors added 14 more in both the third and fourth quarters. With a defensive stand in the third quarter — holding Diamond to just five points — McAuley led nine heading into the final stanza. “It was a team defensive effort all around,” McAuley head coach Tony Witt said. “We put the clamps down on them down the stretch and stretched the lead out in the third quarter. It was a complete effort rebounding and defensively. ”McAuley was led offensively by Noah Black with 20 points. Michael Parrigon and Rocco Bazzano-Joseph added nine more a piece. Black dropped in three triples while Parrigon and Bazzano-Joseph added one more a piece. Ty McDermott finished with 14 points to lead Diamond. Ayden Lorenzen added seven points and chipped in one triple. Blake Irwin added a 3-pointer for the Wildcats as well. “We struggled to shoot the ball tonight,” Diamond head coach Eric Henningsen said. “They packed in a zone and were giving us open looks at the 3 and we couldn’t finish. McAuley also rebounded well. “It’s been a rough start to our season but we know what to focus on moving forward. ”McAuley will play Carthage JV on Friday at 7:30 pm. for the consolation championship. Diamond will meet Sarcoxie to play for 7th place at 6 pm Friday. \n",

      "It was a successful night of basketball inside Hamilton Field House in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Thursday. The Missouri Southern men caused the Central Oklahoma offense to go ice cold in the first half and held a 14-point lead at intermission. The Lions (5-4, 1-2 MIAA) did just enough in the second half to maintain a lead and pull off the 56-50 upset over the No. 6 Bronchos (7-1, 2-1). MSSU held UCO to abysmal shooting numbers for the entire game. After shooting just 35. 7% (10-28) in the first half, that number dipped to an even lower 22. 6% (7-31) in the second half. Overall, the team was just 2-20 from the three-point line. If it wasn't for free shots, the Lions would have left Oklahoma with a much bigger win than six points. UCO shot 14 for 21 at the free throw line and made 13 of those in the second half. The Bronchos did manage two players in double figures as Jaden Wells scored 14 and Cam Givens 12. MSSU saw three players finish the game with double-digit scoring. Winston Dessesow tied UCO's Wells with 14, Vinson Sigmon Jr. added 12 and Ndongo Ndaw scored 11. Ndaw had a double-double with 11 rebounds as well. Christian Bundy pulled down 14 rebounds of his own for the Lions and chipped in nine points. While Southern didn't shoot the ball at a great clip themselves — 30% from the field, 24% from deep — they had six first-half 3-pointers that went a long way in creating that early cushion. MSSU led 36-22 at halftime. The Lions will play at the Newman Jets (4-5, 0-3) on Saturday. \n",

      "It’s been at least a decade since the Thomas Jefferson girls basketball team got off to a start like this. The Cavaliers, who actually trailed after a quarter, unleashed a 38-0 run and cruised to a 53-22 win against visiting Lockwood on Monday night. Thomas Jefferson improved to 5-1 with the win. The Cavaliers hadn’t even gone 3-3 to start a season since 2014. In the first halfBehind seven points from Lockwood’s Gatlyn Clawson, the visitors built a 14-9 lead in the first quarter. But after a three-point play by Kelsey Daniel with 1:42 left in the quarter, the Tigers didn’t score for the next 14 minutes of basketball. The big Cavaliers run started with 40 seconds left in the first quarter when senior Nico Carlson scored. Gabbi Hiebert added a driving layup to cut it to 14-13 after the first. It was 30-14 at halftime. Sophomore Lannah Grigg did most of the damage in the second quarter with 8 points and junior Sarah Mueller added 5. In the second halfHiebert made three 3-pointers in the third quarter. The final one made it 52-19 with a quarter still to play. Thomas Jefferson’s big run ended on a deep 3-pointer by Lockwood’s Adrien Neill with 3:52 left in the third. The Cavaliers only scored one point in the fourth, on a Grigg free throw. A running clock sped things up. Final statsHiebert led the Cavaliers with 17 points, Grigg added 13 and and Mueller scored 12. Alexis Stamps had 5, Tannah Grigg had 4, and Nico Carlson had 2. Thomas Jefferson made 5 of 8 at the line. Lockwood was led by 9 points from Clawson and 5 each from Hannah Steeley and Kelsey Daniel. What they’re saying“We have not seen a season like this in a very long time at Thomas Jefferson for the Lady Cavs. We are playing as a team, they are coming together, they are working hard, they’re sticking to our goals and they’re just getting it done. They’re playing hard defense, coming down and playing smart offense, taking their shots, rebounding, putting it back up. They are literally being so fundamental which we haven’t been in previous years. We hound them on fundamentals, energy and being one team when we step on that court. ”— TJ head coach Traci WalkerUp nextThe Cavaliers won’t take the court until Jan. 5 when they travel to Riverton. \n",

      "It’s the right place for some, but it isn’t for all. But all who go to Ozark Christian College are called. “As I look back on it now, I don’t think I’ve worked a day in my life,” OCC men’s head basketball coach Chris Lahm said. “I mean, it’s just that enjoyable. ”That job: Ministering to and coaching young men on and off of the basketball court. Lahm has been doing that job now for more than 35 years, the last 16 in Joplin. Lahm is also the athletic director at OCC. There’s another coach at the college who knows coaching and serving were exactly what he was called to do. “We’re all called in different aspects of ministry as Christians,” OCC women’s head basketball coach Kyle Wicklund said. “We’re all called to spread the Gospel, but it looks different for every single person. I just felt like God called me when I needed it the most. ”And that feeling continues, trickling down from these head coaches to their athletes. Here’s what junior guard Emmy Colin had to say about her calling: “I just felt the Lord tug on my heart to be all-in for him. I think that looks different for everybody, but, for me it was just getting to go on an adventure to come here and play basketball and volleyball. ”Men’s sophomore guard Josiah Beckenhauer added: “I think it’s just something that God put on my heart. I think if things are lingering on your mind a lot, God will make that known to you. When I was a senior in high school I felt like I was being told to come here and it ended up being the right fit. ”Beckenhauer and Colin are both dual-degree students through OCC and Missouri Southern State University. Beckenhauer is studying business at MSSU and general studies at Ozark as he tries to find the specific area of ministry he wants to go into. Colin’s major is interdisciplinary biblical studies at Ozark and she is studying pre-K through 12 education at MSSU. From the outside looking in, it may appear that attending a Christian college would be different. Those at OCC don’t deny that it may be a little different but they don’t feel as if it’s a big difference. Maybe just one big difference. “I think it can just help shape your identity,” Beckenhauer said. “Knowing that your identity is in Christ … and we just try to play for an audience of one. ”“Being here is different because Jesus is different,” Colin said. Both players added that maybe they value their relationship with Christ a little more than those at a public college or university, but other than that they said they treat college and athletics just the same. The work they put in on a daily basis to build that relationship from devotionals to daily prayers and the classes they’re taking at Ozark helps them as people. The change they’ve felt since arriving on campus is evident. “I feel like I hold myself to a higher standard now, and I know who I want to represent,” Beckenhauer said. Becknhauer and Colin understand that being at a Christian college isn’t a place for everyone. They also wouldn’t want anyone’s decision on college to be swayed because of the Christian title or the fact that it’s a lower level of athletics. The public can sometimes paint an image of being perfect over the word Christian. Neither player feels as if there is any pressure to portray a perfect image. They also are not bothered by playing basketball for a Division II NCCAA school; rather, both players see their opportunity as a perfect two-in-one. “Sarah Rhodes (assistant) sent me a letter in the mail and I was so prideful, I was like, ‘No way I’m going to Ozark to play basketball. Are you kidding me?’” Colin said. “Look where I am now. “My dreams were to go play basketball at the highest level. Now, when I talk to kids, I’m like, ‘When you’re looking back on this experience of you playing in college, what’s most important to you? Is it that you have a good experience and that people love you and you feel known and seen? Or is it that you just want to play Division I basketball no matter what?’”As for Beckenhauer: “The way I see it is it’s a blessing to get to play at all. I came here to learn about Jesus and grow in my faith and on top of that I get the opportunity to continue to play the game of basketball. ”Lahm mentioned having all of those dreams that kids today may have. He was going to be an NBA player one day. Once he saw those dreams weren’t happening, he played basketball at a Christian college and found himself in the job he has now. Wicklund took a similar pattern playing for multiple schools before ultimately becoming an Ambassador at OCC and after some time finding himself back at the school to coach. Lahm noted that he wishes he could convince more kids to come give OCC a look because he knows he can offer a fun atmosphere and still give his kids the game they love. “My favorite part is that the kids have fun,” Lahm said. “We still play basketball and we play to win. ”The coaches added that — just like the players — it may look a little different for them at Ozark than those at public colleges but there isn’t a large difference. Mostly, the differences stem from being able to pour into their players the word of Christ. Wicklund noted that he can probably do that for his players a little more than a coach at MSSU or another public entity could. He added that he’s asked to stop practice and do a devotional with his team if he feels it necessary. Both coaches noted that winning is not the No. 1 priority of their job, but that sharing that Christian faith and teaching young adults that part of basketball and life is what is most important. Wicklund shared what he loves most about that. “Honestly, just living life with the kids,” Wicklund said. “I hate to admit this, but I am getting older. The spunk that they bring as young adults kind of rejuvenates my older soul. ”Wicklund added some insight on just how important sharing the Gospel is for him as a coach at OCC: “I could win five championships, but if I’m not doing what I need to do in spreading the gospel to these girls, I’m not doing my job right. ”\n",

      "Joplin businessman and political leader Ron Richard was inducted Tuesday into the honorary Academy of Missouri Squires during a luncheon meeting at the governor's mansion in Jefferson City. Founded 60 years ago by then-Gov. James T. Blair Jr. , the organization aims to recognize Missourians whose achievements within communities, the state or nation are exemplary. There are no other states with similar honorary organizations, according to information from the Missouri secretary of state. \"It's quite an honor, especially when there hasn't been that many people from Southwest Missouri and Joplin who have been inducted,\" Richard said. \"I'm not sure I deserve it, but it was quite an honor. \"Richard, the owner of C&N Bowling Corp. in Joplin, served in the Missouri Senate from 2010 to 2018. During his tenure, he was president pro tem during the last three years. He also served in the Missouri House from 2002 to 2010, where he was speaker for two years and chairman of the Committee on Jobs and Economic Development. He is the only lawmaker in Missouri history to be elected by peers as both speaker of the House and Senate president pro tem, according to the governor's office. \"All the things I've been lucky enough to do was not all due to me. If it wasn't for a lot of other people, it could not have been done,\" Richard said.  Before he was elected to the state Legislature, Richard was a member of the Joplin City Council who served as mayor from 1994 to 1998. He formerly was a member of the Connect2Culture board of directors and was co-chairman of the Missouri Bicentennial Commission. A Joplin High School graduate, Richard obtained a bachelor's degree in history from Missouri Southern State University and a master's degree in history from Missouri State University in Springfield. He is among a handful of Southwest Missourians to have been selected as a Missouri squire. All Missouri governors and former governors are automatically inducted, and others receive the honor through a decision of committee members who take nominations from the public. Others who have been recognized:• E. L. Dale, of Carthage, recognized for his community contributions as publisher and an owner of the Carthage Press newspaper and a civic leader. Inducted in 1962. • Proctor N. Carter, of Rolla and Joplin, who was director of the Missouri Department of Health's Division of Welfare. Inducted in 1968. • H. Lang Rogers, of Carthage, who as publisher of the Joplin Globe newspaper was the third generation of the Rogers family to hold a management position in the newspaper as well as other business pursuits. He also served on numerous local and state boards and organizations, several related to the University of Missouri and educational organizations, and he was chairman of the Missouri Commission on Higher Education for 13 years. Inducted in 1969. • U. S. Rep. Gene Taylor, of Sarcoxie, an auto dealership owner who was a Republican National Committee member and state delegate before serving from 1973 until 1989 in the U. S. House of Representatives. Inducted in 1983. • Robert Ellis Young, of Carthage, state representative. Inducted in 1983. • Lynn M. Ewing, of Nevada, an attorney who was the third generation in the family law firm there. He served three terms as a state representative and six years as councilman and mayor of Nevada. Inducted in 1994. Richard said he was grateful to Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and to his wife, Patty Richard, and his family for their support. \n",

      "Jurors deliberated about six and a half hours Thursday in Jasper County Circuit Court without reaching a unanimous verdict in the assault trial of Carthage resident Steven Goodman. Judge Dean Dankelson declared a mistrial when the jury informed the court for a second time that it was deadlocked after deliberating all afternoon and into the night. Jurors had first informed the court that they were split and at an impasse after about two and a half hours of deliberation, and the judge had instructed them to continue trying to reach a verdict. Goodman, 58, was tried on a count of first-degree assault in connection with an incident two years ago involving his neighbor, Jack Davis, 62. Davis had gone to his door to confront Goodman about what he had done to scare Davis’ granddaughter when Goodman became upset with the music coming from her vehicle. Goodman gave Davis a shove off his porch that resulted in an injury to his head and purportedly threatened to “finish him off” if a neighbor who came to Davis’ aid did not get him off his property. Goodman claimed he felt threatened by Davis’ manner and was simply defending himself when he gave him a shove, and jurors were given the option of finding Goodman innocent by reason of self-defense. They also were given five guilty verdict options, three of them felony level offenses and two misdemeanors. The punishment ranges of the various guilty verdict options ran from 10 to 30 years for a first-degree assault conviction down to jail time or a fine for the misdemeanor level offenses. \n",

      "Like many local legends, the King of Barton County had quite a following. The huge buck was the talk of country diners once deer season neared. Landowners would show trail-cam photos of the big guy, and the size of the deer seemingly grew with each exchange. “When we were sitting around at a diner and someone mentioned the King, everyone knew what deer they were talking about,” said Corin Berryhill, 37, of Lamar, who has hunted family land in Barton County since his youth. “He just had a reputation. A lot of landowners had trail-cam pictures of him, but he was a smart, old buck. He was mostly nocturnal and didn’t make many mistakes. “Everyone within a 5-mile radius of us knew about this deer. We all dreamed of getting a shot at him. ”With a wide multipoint rack and a long drop tine, the buck was immediately recognizable. Berryhill saw him from a distance midway through last deer season, but it was too far away to shoot. Berryhill got his hopes up on opening day of this year’s Missouri firearms deer season when he and daughter Addison saw the King trailing a doe through the timber on their family farm. The doe stepped out and started feeding on some clover in a field at the edge of a field, and Berryhill was hoping the buck would follow. “There’s a clearing in the trees where he would have to step out into the open before going back into the brush on the other side,” Berryhill said. “Everything was perfect. The wind was in our face, so he couldn’t scent us. We weren’t moving or making noise. But he just stopped and went back into the timber. “Eventually, he circled clear around us, got into another tree line and joined up with the doe on the other side. He never left that timber. ”And Berryhill’s hopes sank. “Others around here had seen the same thing on other hunts,” he said. “They just couldn’t believe the things they had seen that buck do. ”Berryhill got a call from a neighbor later that day, adding to the legend of the King. “My neighbor said he saw that buck on his property, and he got off a long shot at him but missed,” Berryhill said. But on Sunday of opening weekend, the King finally made a fatal mistake. Berryhill took his 11-year-old son, Mason, with him this time, and they headed for some thick cedars. Just when they rounded a bend, they spotted a large doe. Mason lifted his rifle to take a shot when dad noticed a large form slowly making its way through the timber. Berryhill whispered for his son to not to move. He used the scope on his rifle to pick out the movement of the King and waited for him to get into a slight clearing between two big oak trees. By that time, Mason also had his rifle trained on the deer. Dad fired first, and the buck hunched over. Mason’s shot finished the deal. “We were hugging, shouting, high-fiving like crazy,” Berryhill said. “We made so much noise that I don’t think there was another deer left on our property after that. ”When Berryhill inspected the deer, he found that it was a nontypical with 22 scorable points — not a state record, but the biggest buck he had ever taken. To cap it off, he took Mason out later in the season, and the boy shot a big eight-point buck on the family land. Both deer are now at the taxidermist, and will one day be hanging on the wall in the family’s home. For Berryhill, the experience was especially memorable because it took place on private land where he learned to hunt. He remembers tagging along with his dad and bonding during deer season. He remembers shooting a 14-point buck one season. He also recalls the big 10-point that his dad shot and had mounted. “We have 180 acres that has a lot of timber, pasture and prairie grass,” Berryhill said. “I don’t think a lot of deer live there. It leads to another piece of ground that is solid timber. “They’ll cut through our land to that timber, winter wheat, clover and brohm grass. But if you know where to hunt and you’re patient, you’ll always see deer. ”And this year, they saw the right one — the King. \n",

      "Looking for a Christmas miracle?They’re out there. We just saw one in Joplin Thursday night, when employees of Contract Freighters Inc. went shopping as part of their 29th annual Truckload of Treasures campaign. Besides shopping for about 300 children, senior citizens and families as part of the Salvation Army’s Angel Tree program, CFI employees also gave donations of $1,600 each to a number of community service agencies in Joplin. CFI President Greg Orr told us employees raised $41,000 for all aspects of the annual effort, pushing the amount donated over the past 29 years to more than $1 million. “Our employees are the ones that are doing this,” Orr said. “Not only the shopping, but they’re the ones who donated the money, so . . . doing this for 29 years consecutively is a very big deal, and we’re very proud of our people for being able to do this. ”Barbara Haslip, senior manager of finance at CFI, told us: “It’s a wonderful opportunity. It was exciting to be able to do it again. With COVID and stuff, we haven’t been able to do all of this, but the employees really love to be able to give back to their community. ”LecanemabOr how about this?Recently, Japanese drugmaker Eisai and its U. S. partner Biogen announced that their drug lecanemab appeared to slow Alzheimer’s advance in patients. Lecanemab delayed patients’ worsening by about five months over the course of the 18-month study, and lecanemab recipients were 31% less likely to advance to the next stage of the disease during the study. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, “The data presented today (Nov. 29) and published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirms this treatment can meaningfully change the course of the disease for people in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. . . . These peer-reviewed, published results show lecanemab will provide patients more time to participate in daily life and live independently. It could mean many months more of recognizing their spouse, children and grandchildren. Treatments that deliver tangible benefits to those living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s and early Alzheimer’s dementia are as valuable as treatments that extend the lives of those with other terminal diseases. Miracles don’t always have to be complete, they can come in steps. OrionThen there’s this: Consider NASA’s Orion capsule, which returns to Earth today after more than three weeks in space. It recently passed within 80 miles of the lunar surface. While this mission was uncrewed, if today’s return is a success, it paves the way for crewed missions to return to the moon and then to Mars. We live in an age of wonder; the wonder is how often we lose sight of that. \n",

      "MONETT, Mo. — Joplin and Carl Junction girls fared well Saturday in the Monett Swimming Invitational at the Monett YMCA. Carl Junction, with 331 points, finished second, and Joplin (265) finished third among the 12 teams. West Plains collected 362 points to be declared the winner. Monett (248) placed fourth and Lebanon (202) fifth.

      "MOUNT VERNON, Mo. — A 40-year-old man accepted a plea offer this week in a child sexual abuse case involving a 13-year-old victim from Aurora and was granted a suspended sentence and probation. Stephen W. Young, formerly of Nixa, pleaded guilty Monday in Lawrence County Circuit Court to a reduced charge of sexual misconduct with a child in a plea deal calling for a suspended sentence. He had been facing a more serious charge of enticement of a child younger than 15 years old. Judge David Cole accepted the plea bargain and assessed Young four years in prison with execution of the sentence suspended and the defendant placed on supervised probation for five years. According to a probable-cause affidavit, Aurora police received a report in June 2019 of messages of a sexual nature taking place on Instagram between a girl and a 37-year-old man. Young, who lived in Nixa at the time, acknowledged when questioned by a detective that his overtures were of a sexual nature and that he knew the recipient of the messages was underage. \n",

      "MOUNT VERNON, Mo. — A judge ordered a Strafford man to stand trial on robbery and theft charges at a preliminary hearing Thursday in Lawrence County Circuit Court. Associate Judge Matthew Kasper decided at the conclusion of the hearing that there was probable cause for Jeremy D. Redman, 41, to stand trial on counts of first-degree robbery and stealing.

Redman is accused of being one of two suspects who stole several catalytic converters and performance radiators from a rural Miller man's property in June 2021. The owner of the property, Damon Robison, arrived on the scene as the suspects were leaving, and they purportedly threw items out of their car at him and pointed a gun at him in making their getaway, according to a probable-cause affidavit. Robison identified Redman and Michael R. Watkins, 43, of Greenfield, from photo lineups as the thieves. Watkins pleaded guilty to stealing in June and was sentenced to seven years in prison. \n",

      "Mineral and ore specimens from the Tri-State Mining District that were no longer visible in Joplin’s downtown Spiva Park are taking on a new shine with continued work to clean them, remount some and add a few new ones to the park’s entry. Volunteers from the Joplin Historical Society, Joplin History and Mineral Museum and the Joplin Arts District along with descendants of the park’s founder, George A. Spiva, continued work Tuesday on a project to refresh and repair the 56-year-old park at Fourth and Main streets. One of those projects is to unearth and restore an exhibit of minerals and ores in the park’s main walkway that was installed when the park was built in 1966. The display was donated from the private collection of the Joplin Historical Society. The Joplin History and Mineral Museum houses the Everett J. Ritchie Tri-State Mineral Museum, a large collection of ores and minerals and mining exhibits. “If these weren’t found in the dirt here, there would be no city here at all,” said Chris Wiseman, executive director of the museum, of ore discoveries made in the mid-1800s. “It was these things that brought people in from all over and from an early mining camp it turned into the city of Joplin. We brought some replacements out from the historical society’s collection to replace ones that had weathered and just kind of fallen apart over time. “It is such a neat little area, we just wanted to help out if we could. We have got some things that are really not of a grade to display in the museum that are still too nice just to be stored away and never seen. ”Those things are being incorporated into the park’s display, Wiseman said. Paula Callihan, president of the historical society, said the existing mineral display had eroded over time. “It’s a work in progress,” she said, that involved clearing out plant overgrowth that hid the view of some of the rocks. Because it is a city-owned park, the Joplin Parks and Recreation Department will permanently mount the newly donated minerals and a sign identifying the minerals will be installed, Callihan said. Mining and related industries built several cities in Southwest Missouri, Southeast Kansas and Northeast Oklahoma during the 1800s and early 1900s. George A. Spiva dedicated the park in memory or his father, George N. Spiva. The elder Spiva was a powder manufacturer in early Joplin and later operated an explosives company that provided products for the mining industry. He also invested in banking ventures and helped establish the Joplin Stockyards, the YMCA and Freeman Hospital. “It’s a wonderful feeling to see that other people see the need for it to be restored,” said Gay Cragin Currence, the granddaughter of the park founder, of the volunteers who continue to help with the renovation project. Workdays were held in May to install new landscaping of flowering plants, shrubs, and mulch in the park’s flower beds. Scott Cragin, grandson of Spiva, said an effort about 10 years ago did not pan out. “We’re glad to see it regain some momentum,” Cragin said. He said the first stage of the renovation was the landscaping work. Restoration of the mineral display is the second. A third phase will involve repairing the brickwork and walls and decorative features in the park. Cragin said the family also hopes to do some restoration work on the fountain and its original lighting features. Cragin and Callihan said they also are planning are install signs and a kiosk in the park that will give visitors historical information. A sign will mark the site as the former location of the famed House of Lords. Also coming to the park is an 11-foot sign being created by artist Jorge Leyva, a project of the Spiva descendants and the arts district. The park name has never been easily visible to visitors and passersby. Linda Teeter, arts district founder, said a concrete footing has been poured at the site for the installation of the sign. A concrete base also is to be built and the sign may be installed in September if everything is ready by then, she said. In addition, the iron guardrail around the mineral display has been removed for repair and repainting. Similar work will be done on matching guardrails around other park features, Teeter said. Currently volunteers, including the Cragin family, have been watering the new landscaping daily, Teeter said. “We’re still working getting an expert here to clean the four seasonal nymphs in the fountain, the George A. Spiva statue and the mining statue,” Teeter said. The volunteers are being assisted by the Joplin Parks and Recreation Department. \n",

      "Missouri Southern State University marked its fifth top-10 men’s finish in program history Friday in the NCAA Division II Cross Country Championships in Seattle.

      "Missouri Southern State University’s football program has been placed on probation for three years, will see a reduction in scholarships and could vacate wins from its 2019 season after committing multiple NCAA violations over a two-year period. The Division II Committee on Infractions announced the penalties Friday, and said violations included “impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, academic misconduct and violations of countable athletically related activities. ”According to a statement, the former head football coach “violated head coach responsibility rules and ethical conduct rules when he failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance with NCAA rules and was directly involved in violations,” the committee wrote. Although not named in the statement, Jeff Sims was head coach at the time. Sims came to Southern from Garden City Community College in Garden City, Kansas. He went 2-9 in 2019 with the Lions; there was no 2020 season due to COVID-19. Southern announced in December 2020 that he had been “relieved of his duties” and that they would pay him $90,000 in severance and about $20,000 in administrative-leave pay, according to a separation agreement. According to the infractions committee, Sims threatened staff jobs if athletes didn’t perform academically and then didn’t monitor the involvement of the staff in athletes’ academics, leading to an unidentified assistant engaging in academic misconduct. It also said he engaged in unethical conduct by not meeting his obligation to cooperate in the investigation and by denying his involvement. • Additionally, an unidentified former academic advisor provided impermissible benefits “on multiple occasions. ” According to the committee, the advisor had existing relationships with two athletes from a previous job. One lived for free at the advisor’s home “for several months” before enrolling at Southern. The committee counted that as approximately $2,000 in impermissible inducements. The advisor also paid approximately $1,500 to cover an athlete’s outstanding tuition from a previous school, thus allowing him to enroll at Southern. • The advisor also paid $500 in bail for another athlete who had been arrested while enrolled at Southern. Both players eventually repaid the advisor. • Another violation occurred when “the former football head coach” started recruiting a community college player who had played for him at his previous school. That player still owed more than $8,000 in tuition to the previous school, which wouldn’t release his transcript so he could transfer. According to the statement, the coach arranged for an unidentified booster to pay the tuition bill and the player later played in eight games at Southern while ineligible. The booster and player told investigators they had an agreement for the player to cash scholarship checks to repay the money. The player told investigators he had been directed by the head coach to go to a bank, cash the checks and return the money to the head coach so he could repay the booster. The booster reported receiving some of the money, but not all. • The violations of countable athletically-related activities stem from “captain’s practices” held in the summers of 2019 and 2020. These practices, which included seven-on-seven activities, were “directed and observed by members of the coaching staff, resulting in the program exceeding the allowed countable athletics-related activity,” the committee wrote. It added that the head coach admitted he was aware of the practices. • An unidentified former assistant coach pressured a player to complete coursework for a “prospect,” the committee wrote, and threatened to withhold that player’s scholarship if he didn’t complete the online courses. The assistant “strictly advised him not to speak to anyone about that arrangement. ”• The committee also wrote that Sims didn’t promote an atmosphere for compliance. It wrote that Sims “personally created an environment where the athletics leadership and compliance were considered the enemy and used fear and intimidation with his staff members to further that divide. His approach was the antithesis of a compliant program. ”• And he engaged in unethical conduct, the committee wrote, when he didn’t cooperate with the investigation. It wrote he provided “demonstrably false or misleading information to investigators” and did not agree to violations or penalties included in a negotiated resolution with Southern and the advisor. He didn’t respond to a subsequent notice of allegations and “multiple requests” for a response from the committee. The university agreed to the following penalties:• Three years of probation ending Nov. 2, 2025. • A $5,000 fine. • A reduction in football scholarships to 34. 2 for the current academic year. Division II schools are allowed 36. • The vacation of all football records in which ineligible athletes competed. Southern must provide a report listing all such contests within 14 days. • A one-week prohibition against off-campus recruiting. • A one-year show-cause order for the academic advisor. • A four-year show-cause order for the former assistant coach. • A two-year disassociation of the booster. • Additionally, the committee handed Sims a seven-year show-cause order. Show-cause punishments mean penalties could be transferred to any other NCAA school that hires him in the period. Reached by phone on Friday, Sims said he had no comment and had no participation in the process. “I have nothing to do with any of that,” he said. “I’m not involved. ”Asked why he had declined to participate in the investigation, he said it wasn’t fair to ask himself, the assistant coach and former academic advisor to spend “tens of thousands of dollars” on lawyers. “Thousands of dollars were spent on lawyers over several months to investigate violations of a two-win football program from three years ago to punish people that are no longer involved in anyway,” he said in a text message. “Never, not one time in my time at MSSU, were we alerted to any possible violations and we inquired often. We have moved on. I hope MSSU and NCAA can now find positive ways to lead and influence students lives,” he wrote. Sims later added that if the NCAA had said if he would agree to never coach at an NCAA institution and take full responsibility for any violations but not punish Southern or the staff, he would have accepted. “I am not saying we committed any violations,” he wrote. In a release, the university said its NCAA compliance staff had been notified in July 2020 of potential violations and conducted an internal investigation. The university self-reported to the NCAA in October 2020. “Since the time of the violations, both the football program and athletic department are under new leadership, with the arrival of Head Football Coach Atiba Bradley in February 2021 and Director of Athletics Rob Mallory in July 2021. No current MSSU employees were implicated in this investigation,” the university wrote. Mallory, in the release, said he was pleased to have the matter resolved. “I have 100% confidence that under Coach Bradley’s leadership that Lions football is operating with the highest levels of integrity and transparency,” he said. According to the full decision from the infractions committee, the violations came to light when the university’s human resources department conducted an exit interview with a former football assistant. Other former football staff members, and former student-athletes, raised concerns during the subsequent investigation. \n",

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — Cassville’s boys basketball team was averaging 51 points per game during its 6-2 start this season. But the Wildcats were caught in a trap against Neosho’s stifling defense on Wednesday night. The visitors managed just 6 points in the first quarter and 16 in the first half as Neosho, looking to defend its 2021 Black Division championship, opened its Holiday Classic with a dominant 61-43 win in the first round. By halftime, Neosho (7-1) had already forced 14 Cassville turnovers and held its opponent scoreless on 22 of 30 possessions. The hosts had a comfortable 22-point lead at that point. “Defense is kind of what we pride ourselves on, and it’s not necessarily a press or anything special, it’s just about making them take tough shots — forcing the other team to take shots they don’t want to,” said Neosho coach Cody Culp. It didn’t matter that Neosho’s offense took a while to get going; the host Wildcats made just 5-of-18 shots in the first quarter. The game was tied at 4 early on, and Cassville went nearly four minutes without scoring after that. A 3-pointer by Neosho’s Kael Smith just before the buzzer made it 13-6 after a quarter. Neosho outscored Cassville 25-10 in the second period while shooting 57% from the floor and 43% from 3-point range. The hosts were a perfect 6 for 6 at the free throw line. “Started slow offensively but if you hold a team to 4 points that long, eventually you’re going to throw something in and we got a groove going,” Culp said. “They play a pretty good 1-3-1 matchup zone. It’s a little different. So once we got the feeling of it, hang of it, we were in a pretty good spot. ”It was a 38-16 game at the half. Neosho’s Carter Baslee scored the first 5 points of the third quarter. When Isaiah Green scored three minutes in, Neosho led by a game-high 29 points. Cassville (6-3) actually outscored Neosho 27-23 in the second half, but that big deficit was too much to overcome. Cassville finished the game with 20 turnovers (six of them on steals) to Neosho’s nine. and Neosho added 16 assists. Green had a huge night for Neosho, scoring 13 points to go along with 11 rebounds and six assists in just 22 minutes. Baslee scored 11 and grabbed seven rebounds and Carter Fenske added 10 points. Cassville’s leading scorer was Aidan Cook, who tallied 12 points in 25 minutes. Nine different Wildcats scored in the game, and Jon Dunbar was second on the team with 8 points and eight rebounds. Neosho outscored Cassville 23-8 off turnovers, and had 17 points on fast breaks. Culp said the message after the game was to continue taking things one day at a time, just like Neosho did during last season’s tournament. “We were really not worried because they’re seniors, they’ve been through it,” he said. “Today, it was like don’t look ahead to tomorrow, you’ve got to take care of this. I told them (tonight) our main focus is our shoot-around practice tomorrow and we’re going to take it one possession, one game at a time. ”Neosho will face Oklahoma City’s Crooked Oak at 4:30 p. m.

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — Charges against a Goodman resident accused of shooting at the home of another man with a . 30-06 rifle were dismissed Monday in Newton County Circuit Court. Gerald W. Qualls, 34, was scheduled for a preliminary hearing on counts of first-degree assault, armed criminal action, unlawful use of a weapon and sexual misconduct. But the prosecutor's office dismissed the charges when the victim did not show up to testify against Qualls. A witness to the Sept. 23 incident called the Newton County sheriff's office after hearing gunshots followed by two men yelling at each other. A responding deputy learned that the suspect in the shooting had left the scene in a pickup truck after having fired a couple of rounds at the home of a man who had been seeing his ex-girlfriend. The victim told authorities he heard an engine revving outside his home and stepped out to see what was going on. He said Qualls was across the road yelling and cussing, and pointing a rifle at him. He started back into his house and heard two shots fired, one of which struck his house about a foot above his head. The deputy wrote in a probable-cause affidavit that the round entered the home and passed through four separate sections of drywall before lodging in the trim of a living room window. The resident told the deputy that when he retrieved a rifle from his house and fired a warning shot into the air from his front door, Qualls refused to leave, continued cussing and got on top of his truck and exposed himself to him before leaving when the ex-girlfriend drove by. The deputy purportedly found two . 30-06 casings and a bottle of apple liquor at the scene, and a police dog helped locate the rifle in some woods nearby. \n",

Green had three steals for Neosho, and Carter Baslee and Smith each had two. “A lot of those turnovers — I think maybe one was off a press, the rest were just digging in and playing really good half court defense,” Culp said. “Kael Smith really set the tone early; he poked away a couple balls, blocked a shot and dove on the floor. He’s one of our best players, he’s one of our leaders and to see him set the tone right off the bat like ‘This is what we’re doing today,’ that was really good to see. ”Neosho had three players score in double figures and two Wildcats notched double-doubles. Green led the team with 15 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, Baslee had 12 points and 10 boards and Smith had 11 points and six rebounds. Day scored eight points off the bench. Monett’s Salsman scored 16 and Jason Garner had 11 points and four assists. Isiah Meeks grabbed eight rebounds. “The boys had a mission to win the finals so it’s kind of like a shrugged win but you take every win you can get and I’m proud of them for responding today,” Culp said. “It could have been really easy after last night and not as big a crowd to lay downn but I thought this was probably the hardest they’ve played in a while. To turn around and do that in a noon game makes me really proud of them. ”\n",

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — Neosho’s quest to repeat as tournament champions came to a decisive end on Thursday evening in the semifinals. The Crooked Oak boys basketball team, from Oklahoma City, held the Wildcats scoreless for more than eight minutes in building a 20-point halftime lead and went on to win 77-49 to advance to Friday’s Black Division championship at the Neosho Holiday Classic. Neosho, 7-2, will meet Monett at noon Friday in the third-place game, while Crooked Oak (9-1) faces off with Huntsville, Arkansas, for first at 5 p. m. The Wildcats didn’t go down easy on Thursday, though. They opened the third quarter on a 17-7 run to cut the deficit to 10 points with three minutes left in the period before running out of steam. “When you’re down that much and you have to fight that hard to get back, you just run out of gas, I suppose,” Neosho coach Cody Culp said. “I felt like energy-wise (Carter) Baslee, Isaiah Green and Brock (Franklin) kind of brought it. If they’re the ones bringing the energy and they’ve got to play every minute, the car runs out of gas. ”Neosho led 5-4 roughly two minutes in after a basket by Green, but then went scoreless its next 15 possessions until Carter Fenske made a 3-pointer with 5:40 left in the second quarter — and that made it a 23-8 game. The Wildcats committed seven turnovers in the first quarter and 10 in the first half and went to the locker room trailing 42-22 at the break. They were a different team when they came back out, at least for five minutes. Fenske got it to 15 on a 3-pointer and then made it 48-35 with a basket at the 4:19 mark of the third. Kael Smith scored to get it to 12, and then he grabbed an offensive rebound and scored again to make it 49-39 with three minutes left in the quarter. Crooked Oak finished the quarter on a 9-1 run to take back momentum and outscored Neosho 19-8 in the fourth. The Wildcats, after shooting 60% (9-15) in the third, made just 3 of 16 attempts (18. 8%) in the fourth — and they shot 1-of-12 from 3-point range. Overall, Neosho made 3 of 21 attempts from 3-point range; Crooked Oak, meanwhile, was 8 for 14 from beyond the arc, and Elijah Garcia made six of those. Now the Wildcats look to bounce back against Monett. “That’s what I told them,” Culp said. “You have an option. You can lay down or you can show up tomorrow at noon and avenge yourself. There’s not really any other option. ”Green led Neosho with 13 points and four assists. Fenske scored 12 and Smith had 11. The Wildcats were out-rebounded 31-23 and made 6-of-15 attempts at the free throw line. The Ruf Nex of Crooked Oak had three players in double figures. Tymie Adkins-Freeman had 24 points, four assists and three steals. Daevion Hill scored 22 and grabbed 13 rebounds and three blocks. and Garcia scored 20. They shot 19 of 26 at the line. \n",

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — Points were a scarce commodity early on in Friday’s Neosho Holiday Classic girls championship. Unfortunately for the Neosho girls, Fort Smith Northside scored most of them. Defending champion Northside limited the Wildcats to just four points and no field goals in the first half and rolled to a 51-19 win in the afternoon matchup, putting an end to Neosho’s bid for its first tournament title since 2014. “We did not come out the way we wanted to come out tonight,” Neosho coach Daniel Durst said. “I’m not sure what it was but we just really didn’t show up to start with. I got them to start fighting back after halftime but we had dug ourselves a really big hole and it’s hard to dig yourselves out of that. ”Neosho (7-5) trailed by 22 at halftime after missing all 14 shots it took from the field. The Lady Bears (10-2) also struggled offensively early in the game — they scored just nine points in the first quarter — but opened up for 17 in the second. The Wildcats trailed 35-4 early in the third quarter before briefly getting on track offensively. They went on an 8-3 run with baskets from Beclynn Garrett, Maelynn Garrett, Courtney Thomason and Karlee Ellick, but Northside had its lead back up to 31 by the end of the quarter. “That Northside team is really tough and we knew that coming in,” Durst said. “They’re a great basketball team. I told the girls in our walkthrough this morning, I said what you need to do is play as hard as you can to put yourself in position to win at the end of the game and we really stressed that if we were going to win this game it was going to be a close one till the end. Unfortunately we didn’t show up ready to do that today. ”Neosho shot 19. 4% (6-31) in the game, while Northside shot 42. 6% (20-47). The Lady Bears, who’ve won two Arkansas state championships in the last four seasons, had big advantages in rebounds (37-23), turnovers (+7), points in the paint (32-12) and points off turnovers (23-5). Northside coach Rickey Smith said his team has been inconsistent all year but showed some progress on Friday. The Lady Bears feature one senior and one junior and the rest of the roster is mostly sophomores. “Today was the first time in walkthrough you could see our kids looking and listening and focusing the way they need to,” he said. “I’m very proud of our defensive effort. We’ve got some really young, immature kids that didn’t understand the intensity and level we expect to play at Northside … they slip on the jersey and think we’re supposed to win. It doesn’t work that way. They hadn’t been earning it. “These last three games we finally locked in defensively the way we want to play. ”Ellick, Beclynn Garrett and Maelynn Garrett each scored four points for Neosho. Ellick added seven rebounds and Maelynn had five. Northside’s Karys Washington scored 26 and had nine rebounds to pace the Lady Bears.

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — Some of Neosho’s history has returned home after a bit of restoration. The city’s 83-year-old public art piece, “Centennial Mural,” depicting Newton County history, was recently returned to its location in the Neosho Newton County Library after undergoing $15,000 worth of restoration in Kansas City. It is among three murals that are up for restoration through the auspices of the Neosho Arts Council. The other two are the “Rocketdyne Mural” at Crowder College, and “Neosho Mural,” a tile piece on the exterior wall of the Mills Park Centre, across from Big Spring Park at the entrance to downtown. The “Centennial Mural” is the oldest of the three, having been created in 1939. The 7-by-30-foot mural was removed in October and transported to Kansas City, where restoration specialists handled its repair, cleaning and sealing. The completion of its restoration and its reinstallation in the library was recently celebrated with a public reception. The restoration included hand cleaning of the mural’s surface, which had darkened and yellowed after 83 years of being exposed to cigarette smoke and airborne grime. The cleaning allowed the painting’s colors to be restored to their original vibrancy. Fortunately, the restoration specialists were able to reattach a 14-inch square that had been removed from the painting’s canvas. The piece had been cut-out to allow installation of an air vent in Municipal Auditorium, where the mural had hung for 68 years before being removed in 2007 and moved to the library in 2008. “We were fortunate that the cut-out section of the mural was saved,” said Sarah Serio, president of NAC. “This means viewers will now be able to see the mural as it was intended by the artist for the first time in decades. ”Also repaired were structural areas of the mural that had begun to bow after holding its weight for eight decades. The wood of the stretcher bars around which the painting’s canvas was wrapped were repaired and metal braces were added to ensure structural stability. The final step in the restoration was application of a coating ultraviolet light sealant to protect the mural from light damage and to prevent fading. The mural, commissioned to commemorate Newton County’s centennial, depicts 100 years of the county’s history and growth. It includes images of the county’s first settlers and natives of the Osage Indian tribe, scenes from the Civil War, and notable figures and regional industries. The mural was initially commissioned through the renowned artist and Neosho native son Thomas Hart Benton. He turned down the job and recommended one of his Kansas City Art Institute students, Duard Marshall, who went on to gain considerable recognition as an artist. Next in line for restoration will be the “Rocketdyne Mural,” originally installed in the city’s former Rocketdyne plant, The business operated in the late 1950s and 1960s, producing rocket and missile engines for America’s early space exploration. The mural of roughly 9-by-44 feet depicts an Apollo-era space capsule, a satellite, planets, stars and the artist’s interpretation of future space stations. It was created in 1963 by Lawrence Sanchez Jr. , who worked as a technical artist for Rocketdyne. It hung in the plant’s cafeteria until 2013, when it was moved to Crowder College, where it’s displayed on a wall in the science wing of Davidson Hall. Plans for its restoration include cleaning and leveling of panels, replacement of lost paint, and application of UV sealant. Two years after completing that mural, Sanchez created the “Neosho Mural,” the final piece of public art up for restoration. At the same size as the “Rocketdyne Mural,” the tile mural traces the first 125 years of Neosho history. it includes images of early pioneers, as well as local businesses, the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, Rocketdyne and Crowder College. Plans for its restoration include reproduction of missing tiles; removal of crumbing, loose grout; cleaning; and sealing of grout and application of wax on the tiles. The NAC has been conducting a fund drive to pay the costs of revitalizing the murals. The goal is $40,000 with about 80% of the goal, or more than $31,440, raised to date. The money is being raised through individual and corporate donations and fundraisers. Donations toward the restorations may be made online through the NAC website, neoshoarts. net, or by mailing checks to Neosho Arts Council, Mural Restoration Project, P. O.

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — The Neosho wrestling team jumped from Class 3 to Class 4 for the 2022-23 campaign. The Wildcats have spent at least the past 18 years competing in Class 3. With the recent growth within the district, they’ve been moved up to the highest classification in the state of Missouri. Neosho wrestling is a nine-time state championship program. Five of those came in consecutive seasons from 2013-17. The other four came in 2010, 2011, 2019 and 2020. The school also has seen six teams ranked in the country over the course of those nine titles. But, all of those came in Class 3 state tournaments. “It’s going to be tough, but we can compete,” head coach Jeremy Phillips said. “I have no doubt. ”He added that he’s told his wrestlers that they can either look at this as a tough situation or they can see it as a great opportunity to showcase what they are capable of against some of the best teams in the state. “I think the biggest difference with Class 4 is that the talent is deeper,” Phillips said. So far, Neosho wrestling is unranked in Class 4 and doesn’t have any ranked individuals in the state. Phillips certainly didn’t shy away from saying he is fueled by being an underdog. “There’s 10 teams ranked in the state and we’re not even in the picture right now,” Phillips said. “And that’s OK. We’re the underdog. . . . We will earn our respect and we’ll earn our spot. I think that’s the only way that I’d want it, anyway. “I’ve been counted out since I got hired, so, yes. I feed off of it. So, please, give me more. ”How has Phillips coached up nine championship teams and 39 individual state champions?Training triangleHe coaches based on what he calls a training triangle. He works on the technical side of things where he gives “solid” instruction to everyone. Then there’s the physical side. Here, he helps players build their strength but also teaches the importance of being able to endure the length of matches by having good cardio and maintaining that physical strength. Lastly, he works on the mental side of things. You wouldn’t have to look too long to see the motto behind the team this season. Visit “Neosho High School Wrestling” on Facebook and its in multiple posts on that page. The motto has been put on T-shirts. It’s printed out on paper. It’s everywhere. Trust is the key word for their motto. “Trust in the process, in myself, in my team,” is the main line. It also reads: “Process over product, while the product is important, what matters most is who we become through the process of striving for our results or goals. ”A big reason for that motto is the large group of freshman who may be struggling with buying in and trusting the entire process as they tackle the difficulties of adjusting from junior high to high school wrestling. “Selling that to these young kids, they still don’t understand it completely so that’s why our motto is what it is,” Phillips said. He said he sees a lot of potential in this group of freshmen. So much, in fact, that there have been eight freshmen starting on the varsity lineup at times out of 14 spots. “That demonstrates, pretty well, the talent they (freshmen) have and, also, the potential,” Phillips said. He added that he also has talent in the 8th grade group waiting to join the high school squad next year. ExperiencePhillips has experience on this roster as well. Eli Zar returns after a state championship season last year and a runner-up performance in 2021. Collyn Kivett is another experienced returner who took fourth at state last year. Ulysses DeLeon and Nico Olivares add to the team’s list of seniors. Coach added that character is a big part of what he pushes in his wrestling program. He believes that loyalty builds a championship character. He says that character doesn’t always lead to a gold medal but it does show up in the end. “That’s where you have a kid like Nate Copeland, who took fourth last year and shouldn’t have — according to paper and according to everyone else (opponents and judges),” Phillips said. “There’s proof in our process. ”Other medalists returning from last year are Johnny Chrisco (sixth) and Fisher Butler (fifth). Phillips wants to see more consistency from his unit moving forward this year. Up next, the Wildcats will be competing in the KC Stampede in Kansas City this weekend. “There’s several states represented. You’re looking at teams that are going to be ranked across the country,” Phillips said. “It’s the best opportunity for us to see, truly, where we’re at. ”He added that he hopes to see his young competitors grow in terms of toughness this weekend. He knows the KC Stampede will be a physical and tough event for his wrestlers but he thinks it well help them on the physical side of things. So far this year, the Wildcats are undefeated. They won their home tournament, they won the Missouri Duals in Jefferson City, and have defeated everyone in duals so far this season. “We see where we’re at with that training triangle,” Phillips said. “We see where we’re at with the best of the best. ”He added that the mental side of things will be huge, noting that his wrestlers can’t let one loss get them down and deject them for the rest of the tournament. RECORDS AND MOREDuring Phillips’ time at Neosho, the team has had 10 undefeated seasons in duals and four seasons in which it only lost one dual. It also won 12 consecutive Class 3 District 3 championships under Phillips at one point, with the last one coming in 2019. A product of coach Phillips, Blake Stauffer (2011 graduate), has been inducted into the Missouri Wrestling Hall of Fame. Stauffer and others have also went on to even compete at the college ranks after leaving Phillips’ program. Neosho has four of the 10 highest scores in a single dual according to MSHSAA. The perennial powerhouse is tied for the most overall with 84. The program holds the top four performances in a tournament with 616 points being the most. The Wildcats have the top 11 finishes for most individual wins in a season. Their top performance is 699 in 2014-15. They have the first 11 listings on MSHSAA for wins by fall. The most is 403 in 2014-15 as well. They have all but one listing in the top 10 for most takedowns in a season. Phillips is second all-time in career win percentage for Missouri coaches. \n",

      "NEOSHO, Mo. — The city of Neosho is awaiting official word on funding for the second phase of its High Ground Bike Preserve trail in Morse Park. “We have been notified that we were awarded the phase 2 funds, but must wait for the official notification,” City Manager David Kennedy said. “This grant is under strict oversight throughout the process by Missouri DNR (Department of Natural Resources), and they dictate every move in planning and its construction. ”The city began looking for funds to continue the progress made with the first phase and applied through the Missouri DNR Land Water Conservation Fund to finance the next step in expansion of the trails. The grant totals $157,000, of which the city will match $64,800, and much of that will be in-kind work done by the city. “The grant is very controlled and reviewed at every stage,” said Richard Leavens, director of development services. “We have the bike course already planned and an engineering group contracted for the work. We just have a few minor things to firm up, like the bridge design over Hickory Creek. ”In the mid-1990s, Morse Park was acquired by the city after much of the land was deemed a flood zone. Prior to that it was the location of residential homes, businesses and some industrial buildings. “In the late ‘90s, the city began using FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) grants to purchase sections of the area,” Leavens said. “There was a big effort to try and get the flooding problems out of there. and really the only thing you can put in there are structures that would not be affected by flooding. ”The transformation began with ballfields, followed by soccer fields. As different activities became popular, those would be added to the large expanse of land now under Neosho’s oversight. “By putting bike trails at the location, we can recover from flooding a lot easier than if we had several pieces of playground equipment,” Leavens said. Today, Morse Park north and south encompass nearly 400 acres. Kenny Balls, manager of parks and recreation, was involved with the development and at the completion of phase 1 for the Morse Park bike trail system. “Originally our goal was to get 5 miles of bike trails, and (we) ended up with 6. 8 miles in phase 1, and then (will) work toward 10 miles in phase 2,” Balls said. There was a large push in the beginning by large biking groups, one in Neosho and the one in Joplin. “It has kind of been a hand-in-hand effort with both bike groups,” Kennedy said. “We jumped ahead (with the trail project) and got ours completed and now they are in the process of getting more developed in Joplin. Everyone envisioned what Northwest Arkansas has done to open up bike and hiking trails and other ways of getting out into nature. ”Bike NeoshoNeosho has two bike clubs, one of which is Bike Neosho, which has been around since 2018. “I initially made the Facebook page to get people together to go on bike rides,” said Jeff Chase, a member of Bike Neosho. “I have no real connection to the trails or the city of Neosho other than I have petitioned for and volunteered for these trails being built for many years. ”Chase, an avid mountain biker, said he is excited to hear that the city listened to input from bikers to add some more challenging features to the new trail, such as jump lines and launch pads. Combined with the additional miles, bike enthusiasts will be more likely to stay in Neosho after riding to meet up at local establishments. “That is what we were hearing roughly three years ago, that if we could ever get to that 10-mile mark, then we would be an all-day destination instead of a couple-hour ride,” Kennedy said. The phase 2 bike trail will adjoin the phase 1 trail on a 23-acre plot on the hilltop with a bridge that will be added over the Hickory Creek. It will feature more aggressive elements, like a jump line and the launch zone, aptly named Cannonball. “(Bikers) look for something professionally and purposely built for bikes, which have been built to shed water and drain well,” Chase said. “(Additionally), a trail should be challenging enough for a good workout, but also fast and flowy too. ”“A lot of it is adapting to new ideas,” Leavens added. “Something will come at us, and somebody has a new idea, and we shift to look at that possibility. ”The notion that bike trails could add to the community economically is what excites city officials. “One of our local restaurants, Sam’s Cellar, offers transport to and from the trailhead and then come back onto the square,” Kennedy said. Resurgence of squareThe Neosho square has kept many of the historical structures from days gone by. Fresh faces coming into town to try out the trails has gotten the attention of locals, who have now invested in the square by opening restaurants in those historical buildings. But it was not always that way. “It wasn’t like this 25 years ago,” Kennedy said. “It was in pretty bad shape. ”The resurgence of the Neosho square is a welcome sight for city officials, even defying the downturn during the COVID-19 crisis. “There is a lot out there that we want to do, and we have a long way to go,” Balls said. “I think adding the bike trail has given us a lot of attention downtown. ”“We’ve really seen a change in the square,” Kennedy added. “We always had a few cars parked on the square of an evening, but now you may see five or six cars with bikes on racks parked in front of our downtown restaurants. ”\n",

      "NEVADA, Mo. — A 40-year-old man from Nevada, Missouri, waived a preliminary hearing this month on charges that he choked and put a knife to the throat of his wife while threatening to kill her and their children. Richard D. Burris waived the hearing Dec. 1 in Vernon County Circuit Court and was ordered to stand trial on counts of first-degree domestic assault and first-degree child endangerment. Judge Brandon Fisher set the defendant's initial appearance in a trial division of the court for Dec. 13. Sabrina Burris reported to Nevada police on Nov. 3 that her husband had assaulted her the previous night during an argument in their home. According to a probable-cause affidavit filed in the case, she said that he \"suddenly snapped\" and pulled her into a bathroom, where he choked her before punching a wall and threatening to kill her and their children. Fearful that he might harm one of their children, she moved to protect the child and he put a knife to her throat while continuing to threaten to kill her and the children. She said he then pushed her onto a bed, causing the child she had picked up to fly out of her arms. She told police the child was screaming and crying but apparently was not injured. The defendant told police that he was high on methamphetamine at the time and did not remember anything happening between him and his wife. \n",

      "Neosho boys basketball hadn’t seen a winning record in multiple seasons. They hadn’t even seen consecutive seasons of 10 or more wins in a while. Until Brock Franklin, Carter Fenske, Kael Smith, Michael Day, Carter Baslee, Isaiah Green and Jared Siler reached high school, that is. These seven Wildcats are now seniors. “Coming into our freshman year, we set goals for ourselves to be one of the best classes to come through here,” Franklin said. “I think we’ve taken that every day to practice, and that’s the mentality we have every day. ”Over the course of the past three seasons, they’ve accumulated 43 wins and three straight campaigns of at least 13 wins. “Only Brock Franklin really played varsity as a freshman, but they all made our varsity better because they immediately came in competing,” Neosho head coach Zane Culp said. “Seeing a group of seven seniors — we haven’t had seven seniors in a long time either — that wanted to work together through thick or thin and get to this spot … is exciting for the program and the community. … Because there were times where some of them weren’t playing varsity but they stuck to the course and loved each other. ”In the five years prior, Neosho earned 47 wins and just two seasons of 10 or more. “That was our whole dream was to turn a program that hadn’t been doing so great for so many years and be that culture-setting team that I know we’re going to become,” Fenske said. The Wildcats are off to a 5-1 start in the 2022-23 season and are in their fifth year with Culp at the helm of the program. In Culp’s time as head coach, Neosho is 58-54. One thing that has stood out about this group of kids is their togetherness throughout the years. “The main thing you see is the closeness,” Culp said about his seniors. “They really are like brothers. That comes out in both ways that they want to cheer for each other and love each other, but they’ll also fight. Which can be good and bad, especially when you’re at practice competing with each other. ”Smith agreed with that type of bond coach Culp described. “I see a family,” Smith said. “At every point. On and off the court, a family. ”That family atmosphere has powered Neosho the past three seasons. Especially last year when they won 17 games, the program’s most since 2005. The Wildcats were also state ranked at one point last year. “Last year, we had a 23-point-per-game scorer, so we kind of knew who we were going to depend on,” Culp said. “We need to see a bunch of different guys step up every game. So that way when COC starts, we can depend on anyone to go get us a win or get us a bucket in a big moment. ”That 23 ppg last season came from senior K’dyn Waters. Now that he’s graduated, these seniors are ready to prove they can fill that void. Part of proving that begins in the annual Neosho Holiday Classic. That tournament will tip off next Wednesday, Dec. 28. “We won it last year and want to prove to everyone we can win it without K’dyn, too,” Day said. “We love K’dyn Waters and we always will, but we also want to prove to ourselves that we can go win it. ”Culp said that they always expect to win so they hope to be back in the championship game this year. His players reciprocated those expectations:“First off, the Holiday Classic is something we grew up watching when we were kids,” Franklin said. “We get very excited about it. So, to play in it for my fourth year now, it’s an honor and our goal is to go win it in back-to-back years. ”The other guys agreed it was certainly what they’ve got in mind for the big midseason tournament. With these tournaments during the early to middle part of the season, teams can often learn a lot about themselves. Maybe where they’re the strongest or where they need the most improvement. The seniors agreed that offensive consistency needs to be a focus of improvement in the coming weeks and that defense has been a foundation of theirs to this point. “A lot of the games our defense is great and it’s what keeps us in it and able to win it,” Day said. “But, overall if we work on getting good shots every possession and not turning the ball over I think we can be a really good and competitive team. ”Coach Culp has noticed that there’s no panic in his guys this year. At one point this season, they trailed Monett 11-2 early in the game and he said the team never panicked, they just understood the moment and took care of it. The Wildcats may have compiled more wins last year than the program had seen in a single season in 17 years, but the seniors aren’t stopping there. “It was special,” Smith said. “We were trying to get 20. We’re going to get 20 this year. … That’s just a goal and we’re going to get there. ”These guys haven’t just been setting goals since their freshman year. Some of them have been studying the school history as well. Tyler Chaney’s success at Neosho was mentioned as well and they know that during his senior year in 2003 was the last time a Wildcat team reached 20 wins or won back-to-back Holiday Classic titles. They want to leave a similar mark on Neosho as the Missouri State University alum did. Coach Culp knows what his guys have their eyes set on and he’s fine with that. But his goal for them isn’t about numbers. “They like to put numbers on it, but my main thing is we want to win the next day whether that’s a practice or a game,” Culp said. Culp added that he would like for his guys to be able to look back after their season is over and say “We had a chance to win every game. ” He noted that the depth the team has this year has given them the ability to really use that next-man-up mentality. He thinks it could cause lineup problems for opponents as well with the versatility that their roster provides. Neosho has moved up to Class 6 this season but that hasn’t fazed the players in terms of wanting to make a postseason run or the success they want to have. “If we just work hard every day, work hard during games and play as hard as we possibly can, I think anything is possible,” Fenske said. The Wildcats’ next game is at Aurora on Monday at 7:30. They will then meet Cassville on Dec. 28 at 5:30 in the first round of the Neosho Holiday Classic. \n",

      "Ozark Christian men shot the ball 57 times on Saturday inside the Multipurpose Building at OCC. 35 of those 57 shots came from beyond the arc. 11 of those 3-pointers went in and, eventually, Kansas Christian College pulled away for an 89-72 final. The Ambassadors (4-2) have been known to shoot the 3-point shot. They've also been known to make a lot of those shots. They didn't make enough of them this time. OCC trailed KCC by six points at halftime 45-39 and the shooting numbers were respectable. They were just under 50% from the field at 13 of 28. They had already dropped in seven triples while shooting 39% from there (7 of 18). They also went 6 for 7 from the free-throw line. The second half saw a change. The 3-pointer didn't fall the same as Ozark shot just 4 for 17 in the final 20 minutes. KCC on the other hand used a 60% shooting effort from the field to separate themselves. The Ambassadors finished with four in double figures: Joel Pugh (17), Josiah Beckenhauer and Tyler Alarid (16), and Aason Cross (11). KCC had five in double figures: Jamal Clark (19), Noah Brooks (18), Boog Lewis (17), Elazar Conley (14) and Jay Washington (12). Lewis added 11 rebounds for a double-double while also chipping in six assists. OCC is back in action on Thursday, Jan. 5 when they play host to Central Christian College of the Bible. \n",

      "PINEVILLE, Mo. — A judge has ordered a 56-year-old man to stand trial on charges that he choked his wife and beat and doused their son with gasoline when the boy tried to come to her defense. Associate Judge John LePage decided at the end of a preliminary hearing Wednesday in McDonald County Circuit Court that there was probable cause for Rodney Jones, of rural Pineville, to stand trial on counts of first-degree domestic assault and felony child abuse. The judge set the defendant's initial appearance in a trial division for Dec. 22. A probable-cause affidavit states that Jones was \"highly intoxicated\" Sept. 21 when he got in an argument with his wife, grabbed her by the hair and dragged her into a bedroom, where he began choking her with his hands. Their son hit him in the head with a frying pan to get him to stop choking his mother, but the defendant then turned on the boy and hit him several times in the face with a fist. Jones then began throwing items into their yard and lighting them on fire, according to the affidavit. When the wife and son tried to put the fire out, the defendant purportedly doused the boy with gasoline and tried to push him into the fire. The mother and boy finally fled on foot and called for help, according to the affidavit. \n",

      "Rates of COVID-19 have been low in Missouri and the southwest part of the state since February, but health officials advise residents to get a flu shot soon for what is expected to be a “pretty significant” season. “We have had a dip in the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations recently,” said Donna Stokes, infection prevention lead for Mercy Hospital Joplin, adding that there were 12 COVID-19 patients hospitalized there Thursday. “Right now, we’re holding steady with lower numbers. We anticipate an increase in both COVID and flu hospitalizations later. ”The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services reports on its online COVID-19 activity tracker that hospitalizations statewide peaked in January 2022 at more than 3,900. They fell to around 500 in March, slipped further to between 300 and 400 in May, and started rising slightly again in June. There is no local dashboard anymore to report Joplin-area numbers since the nation entered the endemic phase of the outbreak, but state figures show that Joplin has had 35 cases within the past week. There are 47 cases reported in Jasper County. There are 38 cases reported in Newton County with about two new cases coming in per day, said county health director Larry Bergner. “Those news cases per day are really down,” he said. Health providers are starting to see flu cases. Bergner said Newton County has had three cases in weeks. “People are coming in for a flu vaccination, so that’s good,” Bergner said. He encourages people to get both flu and COVID-19 vaccinations or boosters. Stokes said that “right now we are seeing lower numbers (of COVID-19) because people have immunity,” either because they contracted COVID-19 or obtained vaccinations and boosters. But there is an expectation that more variants will develop, which could increase cases again as natural immunity and vaccinations wane. The news isn’t as good for flu season. After the pandemic years in which people were masking, distancing from others and washing their hands regularly, those precautions will be needed again as flu is forecast to return in big numbers, Stokes said. “We’ll see a pretty significant flu season. We’re already seeing an uptick in respiratory viruses such as flu, RSV and others,” Stokes said. Devin Blankenship, assistant director of the Joplin Health Department, said home testing has prevented local health agencies from compiling case rates for COVID-19. He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sewershed studies have been a good source of information on what variants are present in regions. “Omicron B hasn’t made it here yet, but it is in the northeastern states,” including BQ1, BQ1. 1, BA4. 6 and BA. 5, he said. When any of those variants arrive here, the Joplin area could see an uptick in cases, he said. While requests for COVID-19 vaccinations dropped in September, news that there are new variants moving around has people interested in getting shots again, but there isn’t a booster yet for BA. 5, he said. It is the time of the year to get flu vaccines, Blankenship said. Australia, which experiences winter from June through August, had a large flu outbreak this year. “They are a canary for us,” Blankenship said. “They had an early onset of flu and a lot of cases. They are saying it could that way for us in the U. S. ”Health officials expect that because there has been so little flu the past two to three years, “we could be prime targets for getting the flu” this year, Blankenship added. Angela Tucker, director of infection control at Freeman Hospital, said precautions for flu and COVID-19 for hospital personnel are similar in dealing with potentially contagious illnesses. “Per the most current CDC recommendations, we require staff in direct patient care areas to mask universally. Strict adherence to frequent hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment is fundamental in providing basic health care to the community we serve as well as keeping our staff safe and healthy,” Tucker said. \n",

Monett was led by senior Blaine Salsman with 16 points and three 3-pointers. Marcus Young joined him in double figures with 13 more. Seneca had a 22-point third quarter to grab a five-point lead entering the final quarter of play. But that's when the Cubs held up on defense only allowing nine fourth-quarter points. A 15-point showing in that period would be enough to get the win. The fourth quarter was capped off by a buzzer-beating triple from Salsman. \"We played strong defense in the first half with only a few breakdowns that resulted in good shots for them,\" Monett head coach Jeremy Neville said. \"Our turnovers and decision making on offense allowed Seneca to flip momentum. \"Monett opened play with 17 points in the first quarter.

      "The Lion Co-op food and hygiene pantry at Missouri Southern State University seeks donations of small kitchen appliances to give to students in need. Donations of slow cookers, cutting boards, can openers, handheld vacuums, coffee pots, blenders, hot pots, nonstick pans, toaster ovens, toasters and electric kettles through Friday may be brought to Spiva Library’s main circulation desk on campus. The goal is to help students be able to cook and prepare food in their dorm rooms, as well as teach students how to follow recipes and use food that’s not prepackaged, said Andrea Cullers, a co-director of the co-op and an associate professor in the kinesiology department. The appliance drive this year replaces the co-op’s Adopt-A-Lion program, in which community members sponsored a student in December by donating necessities such as hygiene products, food and warm clothing. The co-op opened in August 2018 in the on-campus emergency shelter to aid food-insecure students, faculty and staff. Student volunteers and staff help keep the shelves stocked with food and toiletry items through donations from the campus community and other organizations. Cullers said the space in the shelter, located in the complex of residence halls across the street from the main campus, is isolated and allows the co-op to be open limited hours. A small satellite location in Spiva Library has been successful, and the entire program plans to relocate to the library over the holiday break, she said. “We will be able to help a lot more students,” Cullers said. “That site gets a lot more traffic and use. ”Food insecurity among college students is prevalent nationwide. Food insecurity is defined as the inability to consistently access or afford adequate nutritious food. A 2017 study on the MSSU campus determined that more than 250 students had remained on campus during the winter break when the food pantry is closed. Limited meals are served in Mayes Dining Hall between semesters. \n",

      "The Missouri Southern State University women held a 16-2 lead with a few minutes to go in the first quarter. The Lions’ defense didn’t let up as they went on to defeat Northwest Missouri State 52-37 to open conference play on Thursday evening inside the Leggett & Platt Athletic Center. “Defense is our main focus,” MSSU senior Amaya Johns said. “We don’t focus on what they’re (opponent) doing. We just focus on our defense. ”MSSU (8-0, 1-0 MIAA) finished the opening period with a 20-6 lead and looked to be on cruise control the rest of the way. The Lions outscored NWMSU 32-31 in the final three quarters. If there was ever a game to hold an opponent under 27% percent shooting, this would have been the one. Southern’s Lacy Stokes only played nine minutes in the first half due to two first-quarter fouls and picking up a third in the second quarter. Stokes had 7 points at the break and finished with 18. While it wasn’t a big offensive night for Stokes or the team, the sophomore guard poured in a career high five 3-pointers, two of which came in the fourth quarter — the Lions’ only six points of the final stanza. The Bearcats shot 14 for 52 on the night and just 4 for 15 from beyond the arc. MSSU forced Northwest into 19 turnovers and turned that into 19 points as well. Opening MIAA play with a defensive performance is something the Lions are excited about and hope to continue. “I definitely think we take pride in our defense,” Stokes said. “Offense comes and goes. Like tonight, I don’t think we scored but six points in the fourth quarter. But, we sit down and guard and I just think that’s something you can pride yourself on in winning games later (down) the stretch. ”Even when Stokes was absent with her early foul trouble, the Lions continued to defend and score enough to keep the double-digit lead throughout most of the first half. Head coach Ronnie Ressel contributed that to his bench play. “It gives a lot of confidence to our kids coming off the bench,” Ressel said. “Mia (Topping) came in and did a great job getting us in our offense and executing. “It’s huge. I think this is the second game that Lacy’s been in a little bit of foul trouble and Mia’s come in and done a great job for us. When you can somebody step in and do some quality things for you and stay positive . . . that’s a big plus. ”The Lions’ bench contributed 21 points and was led by the 12 from Johns. The 5-foot-10 forward also pulled down five rebounds. Lacy Stokes led the team with five assists while Madi Stokes led the team in rebounding with eight. MSSU will host Missouri Western on Saturday afternoon with tipoff at 1:30 pm. The Griffons will enter play at 6-2 and 1-0 in MIAA action. Western defeated Pittsburg State University 80-74 on Thursday night. Their only losses came against Minnesota Duluth and Augustana. MSSU also faced Minnesota Duluth earlier this season and defeated them 54-51. The Lions will look to continue their defensive efforts, only allowing a shade over 53 ppg to opponents right now. The Griffons, on the other hand, hope to continue lighting up the scoreboard as they average 83. 75 ppg. Western also carries a four-game winning streak. \n",

      "The Missouri Southern women’s basketball team has climbed to the next rung of the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association’s national rankings ladder. After setting a program record at fifth last week, the Lions rewrote their record books on Monday this week when the WBCA announced a move up to fourth. The jump from five to four comes after a 2-0 week and a 2-0 start to conference play. MSSU defeated MIAA opponents Northwest Missouri State (Thursday) and Missouri Western State (Saturday) at home. The Bearcats couldn’t handle the defensive pressure from the Lions as they shot under 27% for the entire game. MSSU won that one 52-37. They went on to outlast the Griffons as well in a much higher scoring contest. A late run allowed the Lions to grab a 75-69 win. Southern (9-0, 2-0 MIAA) will look to climb another rung of the national rankings this week or at least hold their spot as they play in two more conference matchups. Both games this week will be on the road. The Lions will be at Central Oklahoma (4-2, 1-1) on Thursday. The Bronchos are coming off of a 1-1 week in which they fell to Central Missouri but responded with a 96-75 win over Lincoln on Saturday. Then MSSU will head to Newman (4-4, 1-2) on Saturday. The Jets had a 1-1 week last week in which they defeated Lincoln before falling to UCM. Newman began this week with a home bout with Pittsburg State. The Gorillas won that one 81-58. The Southern men (4-4, 0-2) will also be on the road at UCO and Newman this week. The Bronchos are ranked sixth in the country and have gotten off to a 7-0 start. After rolling past their first four opponents, they’ve seen a little more of a test in their last three games. UCO hadn’t won a game by less than 38 points until an 87-75 win over Cal State San Bernardino on Nov. 26. In MIAA play, the Bronchos beat UCM by six and Lincoln by 15.

      "The medical profession is getting it. Increasingly, it’s recognizing the impact of art on healing, and it’s applying it for improved medical outcomes. All around us are examples of the healing power art. Lori Marble stands as one of those examples. She used art in recovery from brain surgery for a neurological disorder. She told her story of healing through art, leading to art as a life passion, during the Artful Medicine Symposium held recently at Missouri Southern State University. The symposium, presented by the university’s biology and art and design programs, explored the relationship between art and medicine and how experiences in art can improve patient outcomes, as well as health care delivery. In addition to speakers, the symposium included workshops to provide hands on experiences in art as related to therapy, and students shared results of scientific and creative research through juried posters and art exhibits. Marble participated in a panel discussion that also featured Angela Pierce, assistant dean of whole health integration for the Alice Walton School of Medicine, being developed at Bentonville, Arkansas, and Jeffrey Bradley, a psychiatrist with Freeman Health System. Two years ago, Marble began using art to aid in her recovery from a dystonia, a neurological disorder in which the two hemispheres of the brain don’t communication with one another. Early on, it caused the Neosho woman to have muscle spasms, particularly during her sleep, or led one foot to drag out of time with the other one, causing her to easily stumble or fall. After surgery to implant a brain electrode to regulate her movements through electrical currents, Marble used painting to explore the connection between creativity and the hemispheres of the brain, she said. After the electrode was implanted, but not yet activated, she did a series of 10 abstract paintings. She created another series of 10 after the electrode was activated. She called the 20 paintings her “Wonky Series. ”Though typically right-handed, Marble said she painted with her left hand while creating her Wonky Series because the left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain, the one associated with creative functions. The dystonia had affected the right side of her brain, she said. Within an hour of having the brain electrode activated, Marble created a painting that was more flowing and colorful than any of her previous paintings, and her brain communicated her thoughts to her hand more readily, she said. “Art therapy certainly helped me heal,” she said. “It allowed me to focus and re-create an identity for myself. ”It led her on a journey of becoming a prolific abstract painter whose work has been featured in numerous individual and group exhibits and in a juried Missouri bicentennial art exhibit that toured the state last year. “It definitely helped me heal, but it also helps you find your people and become an artist,” she said. Pierce used Marble’s experience as an example of how art therapy basically rewires the brain. She explained that our brains have 86 million neurons that interact in networks that influence our memory, emotions and how we think. Basically, they’re our hardwiring. When there is a break in those networks due to illness or injury, the brain must be rewired, she said. Art therapy helps with that by reactivating, recoding and reconsolidating our damaged neuron networks. It helps reprocess our memory and bringing it into balance with the sensory and emotional inputs to our brains, she said. “Art as therapy has a way of rewiring our brains,” she said. Bradley explained that our mental states are more stable, in greater harmony and allow more clarity of thinking when we feel safe and aren’t fearful of what life is throwing at us. Art therapy offers that safety, he said. As we create music, poetry or art, or when we dance, we feel safety as we pour ourselves into it, controlling its pace and direction. It requires all parts of our brains, including our emotions, to contribute and that results a better internal balance, he said. “Awareness is growing in the therapeutic benefits of art,” he said. “Whether getting it from medical care or just doing it yourself or association with groups of artists, it has therapeutic benefits. ”\n",

      "The rocks and minerals that became the reason for Joplin’s very existence are on display in Joplin’s Spiva Park after volunteers uncovered them from what had become a flower bed. Volunteers and others with the Joplin Arts District, Joplin Historical Society, the Joplin Museum Complex and with the city of Joplin gathered Tuesday at the corner of Fourth and Main streets to rededicate a bed of minerals in Spiva Park and restore them to their educational purpose. Linda Teeter, director of the Joplin Arts District, said the work done to uncover, clean, identify and restore the mineral specimens in the rock bed at the entrance to Spiva Park is the latest in a series of projects designed to restore Spiva Park. “This is the reason why people came here, to Joplin, Webb City, this whole area,” Teeter said. “This is why it became a settlement that we now know as Joplin. These are not just rocks. This is not a rock garden. This is a mineral bed, and it’s historic. ”The display consists of a large stone, a smaller stone behind that one and about 20 other specimens representing the minerals that built Joplin as a mining town and the minerals the miners had to dig through to get to the ores that made money. Teeter said the mineral specimens had been covered with mulch and dirt at some point in the past and the spot was turned into a flower bed around the two larger stones. Chris Wiseman, executive director of the Joplin History & Mineral Museum, was tasked with identifying the minerals that were uncovered. “Sphalerite is the big one,” Wiseman said. “Galena and sphalerite are always found together, but in our area, for every ton they would dig up of galena, they would dig up seven tons of sphalerite. They’re both ores. Sphalerite is the ore for zinc, and galena is the ore for lead. ”Zinc and lead were the minerals that made the Tri-State Mining District one of the richest mining areas in the country. The minerals on display also include dolomite, chert, calcite and hemimorphite. Dolomite and chert were the minerals that miners had to dig through to get to the zinc and lead ore. “One of the things I found interesting is they’re trying to dig through this using steel tools,” Wiseman said. “Chert is harder than steel. You have people in the mines, their jobs were to do nothing but sharpen the drill bits, sharpen the tools. The chert would just wear them down over time. ”Teeter said one of the improvements added to the display is a brass plaque with a QR code that takes a person’s smartphone to the Joplin museum’s website and a page with the history of the park and the identification of the minerals in the bed. Scott Cragin, George A. Spiva’s grandson, said his grandfather created the park in 1966 to preserve Joplin’s history and to act as a learning tool for children and adults to teach about why Joplin is Joplin. “I think the QR code is great,” Cragin said. “People can look at that, but they’re saying, ‘What is that?’ Now you can scan it, and it’ll tell you what it is and the history of the park. We’re also working with the Joplin Historical Society on a kiosk or storyboards around the park for history. The city did a survey of citizens, and one of the top two things the citizens wanted to know more about was history. We’re going to be putting the history out as well as restoring the park in general. ”The specimen bed and the new Spiva Park sign installed in October are two parts of what Teeter and Cragin say will be a deep restoration of the park as a whole. Paula Callihan, president of the Joplin Historical Society, said the park needs attention so it can continue to be a hub of activity in Joplin. “This is a start of a big campaign, and we were just talking about how important this corner was in 1900,” Callihan said. “This corner was the center of the universe in this part of the country, even compared to places like Kansas City and St. Louis. The House of Lords stood here, the Keystone Hotel, the Connor Hotel, Miner’s Bank, Joplin Globe, this was the hub of the universe. I’m sure Mr. Spiva kind of realized how important this spot was, and he didn’t want people to forget about it. ”Teeter said the statues of the miner on the stage and of George A. Spiva sitting on a bench need to be cleaned and repaired, which will require them to be sent to a specialist. The fountain needs reconstruction and plumbing work, and the stage needs to be rebuilt. Cragin said the groups expect to start a capital campaign in conjunction with Joplin’s 150th birthday celebration in 2023 to raise the money to restore the park. “I think my grandfather would be overjoyed because before we started, the park had been neglected for a number of years,” Cragin said. “The fountain used to have seven different patterns and lights that would change, and there was indirect lighting all over the park. None of that works anymore. ”\n",

      "The third-ranked Lions met No. 17 Central Missouri Tuesday night inside the Leggett & Platt Athletic Center and found themselves in a hole early in the fourth quarter. That’s when Missouri Southern (11-1, 4-1 MIAA) found its offense. But the comeback fell one shot short as the Jennies closed it out and pulled off the 73-71 upset in Joplin. Down 59-44, head coach Ronnie Ressel took a timeout. “We were talking about getting points, sitting down on defense and stringing together some stops,” MSSU guard Lacy Stokes said. Out of the timeout, the Lions found their shot. Kryslyn Jones dropped in a triple on the first possession. After one of those necessary stops that Stokes mentioned, Madi Stokes added a bucket on a quick turnaround in the lane to make it 59-49. MSSU continued its run when Jones added another 3-pointer and Lacy Stokes followed it up with an and-1 layup to bring the team six points closer. After seeing their 15-point lead quickly diminish to just four points, in a matter of a few minutes, the Jennies got to the basket and got a couple of easy lay-ins to extend the lead back out to eight at 63-55. It was Amaya Johns’ turn to find the groove from beyond the arc. Johns lined one up from the top of the key and buried it. UCM answered with another quick layup. Johns and the Lions came back down the floor and as soon as the ball found the 5-foot-10 senior’s hands she fired it up again. It found the bottom of the net to make it 65-61. On the next possession, Layne Skiles was in perfect position as she caught an offensive rebound and went back up with it. The shot was no good but Skiles was fouled and cashed in on both free throws making it a two-point game. The Lions hadn’t been this close since it was a 27-25 game in the second quarter. Central Missouri’s leader for the night, Brooke Littrell, added a layup to take the lead back to four for the Jennies. The Lions answered quickly as Lacy Stokes hit her fourth triple of the night — this one coming from the right wing to make it 67-66. Littrell tallied 24 points and 16 rebounds and had a double-double by halftime with 13 and 10. The teams traded buckets before Southern was forced to foul and send UCM’s Lauren Frost to the charity stripe. Frost went 1 for 2 on that trip and the Lions were down 70-68. Coming out of a timeout, Lacy Stokes attacked the defense of Central Missouri and drew a quick double team with 18 seconds to go. Stokes kicked it out to Amaya Johns for a 3-pointer. The attempt was no good and the rebound went to UCM forcing another foul from the Lions. Olivia Nelson made both charities for the Jennies to make it 72-68. With about eight seconds left, Stokes took the inbound pass and raced up floor for a quick stepback triple as the Lions never gave in. “That’s what I love about this team,” Ressel said. “They don’t have any quit. That word is not in their vocabulary. They’re just going to continue to fight and make plays. ”Down 72-71 the Lions were forced to foul once again. This time, they were only left with 1. 6 seconds on the clock. UCM’s Nelson missed her first attempt and made the second. The inbound pass went to Lacy Stokes. She took one dribble and fired up a heave from near half court that was no good as the clock hit zero and the Lions’ 11-game win streak to begin the season came to an end. MSSU shot just 37% from the field for the game and really improved that number with its 56% shooting in the fourth quarter. The Lions went 9 for 16 in the period and made six of their 11 3-point baskets. MSSU also finished a perfect 10 for 10 on free throws. A tipping point in the game could have been rebounding. UCM won that battle 46 to 32. Which helped lead to the 12-8 advantage in second-chance points for the Jennies. The Lions will be back in action after a two-week hiatus on Friday, Dec. 30, at home against the University of Illinois-Springfield. UIS is currently 0-9 but will play two more games prior to meeting with Southern. “Defensively, we have to do a better job,” Ressel said about his team moving forward. “I don’t think our defense was as good as it has been in the previous 11 games. We allowed them (UCM) to get where they wanted to, too easily. “Offensively, we just have to knock some shots down. We had some good looks throughout the game. We just have to jump up and knock those shots down. If you do that consistently, you’re not going to get yourself in a 15-point deficit. ”ABOUT THE STREAKMSSU’s last loss at home came on Dec. 16 of last year, also against UCM. Their last regular season loss was on Jan. 3 at Missouri Western. The Lions had won 13 straight at home and 26 consecutive in the regular season. \n",

      "There now is no mistaking a downtown Joplin park that has been obscured for some time by the shade of mature trees and overgrown shrubs. Previously only identified by a small plaque in the ground that was not visible from the streets, the park has a new presence on the northeast corner of Fourth and Main streets as the result of an artist’s work to craft a 12-foot marker that announces that it is Spiva Park. The sign was commissioned from local artist and fabricator Jorge Leyva by the Joplin Arts District and descendants of the park’s founder, George A. Spiva. In a dedication ceremony Wednesday at the park, the arts district executive director, Linda Teeter, conveyed the sign to the city and the people of Joplin to make the park more visible and to honor the legacy of the businessman, civic leader and arts patron for whom it is named. Spiva bought the land and had the park designed and constructed to give to the city in 1966 in honor of his father. He was the son of George N. Spiva, who started working in Joplin-area mines but became an explosives powder manufacturer for the mining industry. He ultimately sold his operation to the DuPonts. He was regarded was one of Joplin’s foremost business, financial and civic leaders. Despite the Spiva family’s position in the community, Teeter said she learned in the last couple of years that many people did not know the name of Spiva Park. “I was shocked by this,” Teeter said. “But the park itself should have had a name that stood out. ”That lack of identity became the inspiration for a project she led this year to renovate the city park and to commission the sign. “One of the things I never understood is why there was never a sign here,” she said. “But the more I learned about George A. Spiva, who designed and built the park, the more I realized that his spirit was about being quiet,” allowing the community to enjoy the park without fanfare. She felt that it was time that one of Spiva’s important contributions to Joplin be recognized. She and the arts district board worked with Spiva’s family to renovate the park. Fundraising was conducted to commission the sign from Leyva, who is known for his community art projects. Spiva’s grandchildren contributed to the effort. Leyva also is a friend of the Spiva family. “It was a real honor to be able to participate in the project,” Leyva said. While there wasn’t a visible marker in the park before, “now it seems like nobody is going to miss it. And it’s important because it is something Joplin has pride in and is something we all are proud of. ”Mayor Doug Lawson said that “it’s good Joplin has people in our city who love Joplin. They don’t just think, ‘It would be nice if we had such and such. ’ They make it happen. ”Lawson said he once suggested that Missouri Southern State University be renamed Spiva University. He felt that would have been appropriate. “I knew the Spiva family had been important to Joplin since the beginning of our city” as a mining town. “Each generation of Spivas has made a significant contribution to our city. ”While the front of the sign bears the Spiva name, a sculpture of an iris graces the back of the sign. The iris is not only the city flower but was a favorite of Spiva’s and of his daughter, Joy Spiva Cragin, said her son, Scott Cragin. “We would like to see the park continue to be restored to something like it was in 1966 when it was dedicated,” Scott Cragin said at the ceremony. “We hope it continues to be a special place for downtown Joplin. ”\n",

      "Three events this week will celebrate renovations made to downtown Joplin’s Spiva Park, and recognize local and national arts efforts. A dedication ceremony for a new artist-made Spiva Park sign will be held at 2 p. m. Wednesday in the park at Fourth and Main streets. Linda Teeter, executive director of the Joplin Arts District, who led the effort to reinvigorate the park with the first easily visible sign marking the name, will gift it to the city of Joplin during the ceremony. The sign was funded with donations by the Spiva grandchildren, descendants of the park’s founder. Artist Jorge Leyva, the sign’s designer, will be on hand, as will Spiva’s grandchildren. Mayor Doug Lawson will preside at the ceremony with parks director Paul Bloomberg also representing the city, along with board members of the Joplin Arts District. The late George A. Spiva was a businessman, philanthropist and arts supporter who built the park and donated it to the city in 1966 in honor of his father, George N. Spiva. The elder Spiva was the founder of an explosives company during the mining era. In addition to representatives of the family, the arts district and the city, representatives of other organizations — including the Joplin History & Mineral Museum and the Joplin Historical Society — along with volunteers from local businesses worked in the park this spring to plant new flowers and shrubs, update a mineral exhibit at the entrance to the park, paint railings and clean features of a fountain that anchors the park. Another art recognition event is planned for 5 p. m. Thursday when the mayor will present a proclamation at City Hall recognizing October as National Arts and Humanities Month. Teeter said National Arts and Humanities Month was established in 1993 and is celebrated every October in the United States. It was initiated to encourage Americans to explore and participate in new facets of the arts and humanities. Local artists, musicians and representatives of arts organizations and businesses have been invited to attend, officials said. The mayor also will recognize the 15th year of the downtown ArtWalk with a proclamation. The event, originally held on the third Thursday of the month, now is held the first Thursday of March through October with exhibits, music and performances in historic downtown venues. The ArtWalk was started by Teeter, an artist, in 2008. The event has grown from 12 participating artists in one building to include nine to 12 locations that allow artists to display their works and talents while promoting arts networking within the community. The ceremony will kick off the last monthly ArtWalk event of the year from 5:30 to 8:30 p. m. Thursday. All of the events are free and open to the public. \n",

      "Tis the season for giving, and area residents are leading the way. We applaud the many examples they set. This week, members of Joplin’s First Community Church made their annual end-of-year donations from their charitable trust. Recipients included Lafayette House, Watered Gardens, Missouri Southern State University’s Lion Co-op, the Area Agency on Aging’s Meals on Wheels program, Souls Harbor, the Alliance of Southwest Missouri’s parenting program, Crosslines of Joplin and the Joplin Community Clinic. Dianna Gurley, executive director of Souls Harbor, told us: “It’s wonderful that First Community brings everyone in the community together to work as a team, to help move our community forward. ”It’s not just about the money, either. Many members of First Community Church members are hands-on, working with these organizations. Russell Willoughby, minister at the church, said: “The name of our church is First Community Church of Joplin, and the ‘community’ not only defines us as a community of faith internally, but also we believe it has an outward focus to it. We’re also here for the community. It’s our way of trying to walk in the steps of Jesus. ”What a great example for the rest of us!Historic donationMeanwhile, employees of Walmart in McDonald County met recently with representatives of the county historical society, a county commissioner and a state represenative at the historic courthouse and museum in Pineville to present a check for $10,000. The gift was made toward the historical society’s “Make the Match” campaign. The group started the campaign earlier this year after state Rep. Dirk Deaton helped to secure a grant to assist with historic preservation efforts. Empty BowlsAlso, last week Watered Gardens presented donations with money raised from the 10th annual Empty Bowls event, made possible with the help of area artists, restaurants and more. These are just a handful of the many examples of giving that we encourage others to emulate not just during the holidays, but throughout the year,. \n",

      "To simply say it’s the end of an era would be an understatement. John Roderique, who guided the Webb City football team to 13 state championships and one of the greatest coaches in Missouri history, announced on Monday that the 2022 season will be his last. He’s retiring at the end of the school year. “I’m excited (and a little sad) to announce my retirement at the end of this school year,” Roderique said in a release from the school. “I have loved my role as the head football coach and Athletic Director at Webb City High School and will cherish the friendships and memories. From the bottom of my heart – thank you all. ”Roderique, a Webb City High School graduate, took over as head coach before the 1997 season and promptly went 14-0 and won his first championship. He followed that up with titles in 2000, 2001, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2019 and 2021. In his 26 years as head coach, he compiled a record of 315 wins and just 34 losses. The Cardinals went to the playoffs 23 times during that time. Webb City won 22-straight district championships under his tenure, a streak that ended this fall.  This is a developing story and will be updated.  \n",

      "Tour leaders didn’t expect the students to work that fast. A group of 15 Stapleton Elementary students took on a task Monday at Watered Gardens — they helped prepare for future meals by wrapping napkins and silverware. Within minutes, they had 256 sets wrapped and tied with holiday ribbons. The work was done so quickly that Watered Gardens officials gave the students an expanded tour of the ministry’s facilities and resources for helping homeless and poverty-stricken people. “I think they are having fun,” said Heather Brodrick, adviser for the student group. “We haven’t been able to get out for field trips since COVID. This is our first field trip since then, and they are excited to go out and see things in the community. ”The students are members of a group called SOAR that work on exhibiting positive character traits. A large part of their activities consists of community projects. The group organized a food drive for December’s project. Combined, the school donated 1,819 items to Watered Gardens’ Mission Kitchen, a food pantry where recipients in need can perform volunteer work in exchange for groceries. Those items were delivered Monday, the same day the SOAR students were given a tour of the ministry. Several of them were excited to see the food items so quickly placed on the shelves. The donation came in at a good time. Officials leading the tour told the students the shelves had been pretty empty. “Typically this time of year, we see an increase in need,” said Ruth Willoughby, outreach coordinator for the ministry. “Especially with prices going up, we serve many families. We have seen a 100% increase in the need for food over the last couple of months. ”Watered Gardens is a gospel rescue mission that works with area churches to provide services to help people in need. The entirety of its annual budget comes from private donations, Willoughby said. The ministry works to start relationships with people in need, meet them where they are and walk them out of poverty. Because the mission uses a model it calls “partnering,” where recipients trade time and work for services from meals to accommodations, it is not eligible to receive federal grants and other donations funded through tax revenues. That means while the donation from Stapleton’s community is generous, it will go only so far, Willoughby said. “Hunger knows no end,” Willoughby said. “We are always searching for groups willing to partner with us for a food drive, to keep our shelves stocked. ”\n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo. — It was a tale of two halves for the East Newton boys basketball team on Saturday. Marshall Renner and Jack Cook took turns getting hot in the first half and helped the Patriots to a 28-25 halftime lead against Sunrise Christian Academy. But Sunrise outscored East Newton 23-4 in the third quarter and went on to dispatch the Patriots 60-43 in action at the 4 States Challenge in Webb City. “We played at the tempo we could be successful at against that team,” said East Newton assistant Bob Coffey. “The biggest thing was we got after them on the boards. That was one of the keys. We knew today that somehow we were going to have to be plus on the offensive boards and we were plus-1 at halftime. “We were just flat in the third quarter and they made shots. ”Coffey coached the Patriots on Saturday after head coach Kyle Fields picked up two technicals on Friday night against Aurora. The Patriots were undersized against Sunrise, which featured 6-foot-8 sophomore Marko Pavlovic and a bevy of others standing 6-2 or taller. But East Newton wasn’t phased in the first half. The Patriots trailed 14-13 after a quarter with Renner making three 3-pointers and scoring 11 in the first eight minutes. Then Cook took over in the second, adding three more triples and matching Renner’s 11 points, to help the Patriots lead by as many as 6. Sunrise took over in the third. East Newton didn’t score until Renner made two free throws with 4:45 left in the quarter, and the team’s first field goal came with 2:04 remaining. It was 48-32 heading into the fourth. “The message was to tighten up the pressure a little bit on defense,” Sunrise coach Jeff Peterson said. “Use our length, speed and athleticism a little more. We weren’t doing a good job utilizing that in the first half. ”Sunrise led by as many as 22 in the final period before the Patriots made some noise again. Braxton Wolfe turned in a three-point play, and then Robert McFarland scored five straight to cut it to 14 with 5:27 left to play. Sunrise turned it over on five straight possessions, and when Renner scored at the 3:35 mark the Patriots trailed 55-43. They weren’t able to score again. “They’re very disciplined and they have guys who can hurt you in a few different ways,” Peterson said of the Patriots. “Even guys who didn’t show up when I was scouting them played really well tonight. Super well coached and I was impressed with them because they gave us all we could handle there in the first half, and a little bit of a scare in the fourth quarter, too. ”“I did like the fact we rallied a bit and didn’t go away too quietly,” Coffey said. Renner finished with 17 points, Cook scored 11, McFarland had 10, and Wolfe added 5. Sunrise had three score in double figures. East Newton fell to 4-4 with the loss. The team travels to Ava on Dec. 20. \n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo. — It was raining threes early on at Webb City High School when the Cardinals met the Monett Cubs for a Saturday evening bout in the 4 States Challenge. Webb City (5-2) jumped out to a 24-5 lead and used that quick start to hang on for a 64-55 win over Monett. “Webb City got off to such a great start tonight and defensively, we weren’t able to slow the game down,” Monett head coach Jeremy Neville said. Joe Adams led the charge from beyond the arc with three first-quarter triples and five total on his way to a 21-point performance. “He’s (Adams) shooting the ball really confidently,” Webb City head coach Jason Horn said. “You have to give credit to his teammates. They’re finding him and they’re not playing selfishly. ”“I felt good coming in,” Adams said. “We had two shootarounds this morning. So, we got enough shots up to where I would be able to knock them down. It feels good to be able to start hot and get going. . . . It’s all just a rhythm thing. My teammates kept getting me the ball once they saw I hit one. ”The Cardinals made three consecutive 3-pointers at one point when Adams knocked down two in a row and Barron Duda followed him up with one more. “It was huge for us,” Horn said. “We kind of live and die by the three. I thought our guys did a good job of getting downhill, drawing the defense and then making the right read and making the right kick. “Alex (Martin) was great in the post drawing doubles and he was able to hit Joe (Adams) and Barron (Duda) and they were able to get some rhythm looks from three. Those guys, if you give them an inch, they’re going to make you pay. ”The Cardinals’ largest lead was 19 points at two different times. Once in the first quarter (24-5) and again in the third quarter (50-31). But, the Cubs (3-4) started clawing back at about that time. They closed the third stanza on a 6-1 run to make it 51-37. “Really proud of how our kids hung in the game and eventually got them (Webb City) slowed down so that we could execute a little more,” Neville said. Behind the play of their big man, Isiah Meeks, they got the deficit all the way back down to four at 58-54 during the fourth quarter. Senior guard Jason Garner chipped in during the comeback effort as well. The duo combined for 13 of the team’s 18 fourth-quarter points. “You have to give credit to them. They got the ball in to their big,” Horn said. “He struggled early but he started making some plays late. Some other guys hit some shots and you could feel their confidence rising. ”Meeks finished with 24 points in the contest and shot 3 for 6 from the free throw line. Garner scored 14 and found himself making an impact defensively during the comeback effort. He drew two charges in the game and continuously got his hands on the ball coming away with multiple steals. Webb City would go on to slam the door on Monett scoring six of the game’s final seven points. The Cardinals put a lot of focus into a different gameplan on the defensive end as they were honed in on the Cubs’ 3-point shooter, Blaine Salsman, all game long. “We were keying on him (Salsman) early,” Horn said. “We changed our defensive approach for him. He’s a prolific shooter. He’s someone we thought could make enough shots, obviously, to win the game. So, we made a concerted effort to try to take him out of the game and make someone else beat us. We were fortunate enough that it worked and we were able to get a win. ”They didn’t allow him much as Salsman only tallied four points in the game on two layups. One very acrobatic finish on an up-and-under move while he hung in the air trying to protect the ball from Webb City defenders. “We’re running into that with several teams now,” Neville said. “They’re being real physical on him (Salsman) and really face-guarding him, getting in his face and running through screens. ”Duda added to the Cardinals in double figures with 13. Martin added 11 more. Webb City plays against Kirksville in the 12 Courts of Christmas on Thursday, Dec. 29 in Kansas City. The Cardinals hope to keep that offensive firepower rolling. “It helps a lot,” Adams said about the hot shooting night. “It gives us an idea of what we should be doing and what all we need to do to win. . . . As long as we can share the ball and get everyone going then we’re good. ”\n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo. — More than 1,100 veterans laid to rest at Mount Hope Cemetery were remembered and honored during a ceremony Saturday as volunteers placed wreaths at their headstones while speaking their names aloud. Saturday marked National Wreaths Across America Day, an annual event that recognizes the sacrifices of the nation’s veterans with wreath-laying ceremonies each December. This year, more than 2. 5 million veterans’ graves were adorned with handmade wreaths at more than 3,600 participating locations worldwide. The nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, was founded by Maine businessman Morrill Worcester in 1992 to continue and expand the annual wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. The mission of Wreaths Across America is to remember the fallen, honor those who served and teach the next generation the value of freedom. Each live wreath at Mount Hope Cemetery was funded by donations from individuals, businesses and organizations. Susie Crutcher, local project coordinator, said more than 100 volunteers helped place the wreaths at Mount Hope and she believes it was a huge success. This is the first year that the cemetery in Webb City was a participating location. “I hope you know that this is for you,” she said to the crowd. “This is for our veterans and it’s our way of saying thank you to those who gave it all and those who are still giving. ”Crutcher is the oldest daughter of Bruce Benson, a U. S. Army veteran of World War II who played taps on his cornet every day at sundown near the Webb City post office. Known widely by the community as “Webb City’s Bugle Boy,” Benson lived in Webb City for 73 years. He died at age 95 in 2020 and is buried at Mount Hope. Webb City JROTC served as the honor guard and led the pledge of allegiance at the Veterans Memorial Wall during the ceremony. Boy Scout Troop 25 laid wreaths at each of the memorial pillars honoring U. S. Navy, Army, Air Force, Coast Guard and Marine Corps veterans. Madalynn Arnall, 15, a freshman at Webb City High School, played taps on her trumpet at the end of the ceremony. Arnall said this was her first time performing the song at a veteran event and that she was grateful for the opportunity. “I’ve been playing trumpet since the sixth grade,” she said. “I was really glad I was able to do it. ”The wreaths are made of balsam fir grown in Maine. CFI helps deliver the wreaths every year to sites in Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D. C. Adam Sparlin, driver advocate at CFI, said he helps coordinate the nationwide efforts and has been involved with Wreaths Across America for five years. “This is an important part of our identity, as a company, and mine,” he said. “My grandfather and father were both veterans. My grandfather served in the U. S. Army and my father was in the Air Force. It’s just a way that I can give back. ”Sparlin said CFI has been delivering wreaths to Fort Scott (Kansas) National Cemetery for about a decade and he was excited to hear that a local ceremony was slated at Mount Hope. “It’s a big honor for CFI,” he said. “I’d love to see this here again next year. ”\n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo. — Ranked 10th in Class 2, the College Heights boys basketball team didn’t make a single three-point shot on Saturday against Liberal. The Cougars didn’t need to. College Heights turned a five-point lead in the second quarter into a 21-point lead by halftime and rolled to a 53-26 win over the Bulldogs in the 4 States Challenge at Webb City. The Cougars improved to 7-2 with the win and dropped Liberal to 2-5. In the first halfCollege Heights junior Caleb Quade scored all 12 of his points in the first half and had seven in the first eight minutes to help the Cougars to a 13-6 lead. It was 13-8 early in the second after Liberal senior Matt Boehne scored, but then College Heights went on a 17-0 run to open it up. Senior Curtis Davenport had six points in the second quarter and senior Bo Sitton added four free throws as the Cougars went into the half leading 35-14. In the second halfLiberal managed just two points in the third quarter, on a field goal by senior Chase Ray. Junior Luke Bott added two 3-pointers in the fourth, but the Bulldogs scored just 10 points in the final 16 minutes. It was a 30-point game by the end of the third, and much of the fourth was played with a running clock. Final statsDespite winning by nearly 30, College Heights had just two players in double figures: Quade had 12 and Davenport 17. But the Cougars showed off their depth, with eight players scoring in the game. Sitton finished with 8, Liam Nelson scored 4; Jayce Walker, Logan Decker and Ben Thomas each scored 2; and Noah Hipple scored 1. The Cougars struggled at the free throw line, making 10 of 23. Liberal’s Matt Boehne and Luke Bott each had 6; Kale Marti, Isaac Edwards and Chase Ray each had 4; and Payton Morrow had 2. The Bulldogs were 0 for 4 at the line. Bott had two 3-pointers off the bench. What they’re saying“We made some adjustments and we found what was open. Our passing wasn’t very good there for a while but finally our zone — we got some steals off our press. That kind of changed it right there. Got some steals and got some layups. Amazing how many layups, how much easier that is. I don’t think we hit a three all night because we didn’t have to. I think the best part was when we came out the second half and had a good third quarter. When you get a big lead you have a tendency to go flat so I was proud of our kids for the third quarter there. ”— College Heights head coach Eric Johnson“We’ve really had a frustrating start to the year because we only lost one senior last year and we had a good year. I don’t know what it’s been. I think it’s getting in our head a little bit and it’s just kind of a mental thing. We’ve really struggled to score this year. We’re shooting 32% on the year. I think we’re getting there. There have been two things wrong with us this year. We’ve struggled to score and defensively we haven’t been where we were at. I feel like today we did a good job defensively flying around so that part of our game is getting there. Once shots start to fall we’ll be okay. I wasn’t upset with the way we played, we just need to execute a little better on offense. ”— Liberal head coachTravis WaltonUp nextCollege Heights is off until the new year. The Cougars travel to Bronaugh (2-4) on Jan. 3. Their next home game is Jan. 12 against Pierce City. Liberal will play St. Mary’s Colgan on Monday and host Diamond (1-8) on Tuesday. \n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo. — The Joplin’s boys basketball team saw a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter evaporate in Friday’s 60-59 loss to Lee’s Summit. But the Eagles put Rogers, Arkansas, away early on Saturday. Joplin used a 9-0 run in the second quarter and a 25-point barrage in the third to finish off the Mounties 68-48 in the nightcap of the 4 States Challenge at Webb City. “Closed it out,” Joplin coach Bronson Schaake said. He said the Eagles lacked some game awareness on Friday night but showed they learned on Saturday. “Good bounce back win from last night,” he said. The 9-0 run came with Joplin trailing 16-14 early in the second quarter. Junior Whit Hafer got it started with two free throws and later added a third, junior All Wright scored five points and had a dunk, and when junior Hobbs Gooch scored at the 2:49 mark the Eagles led 25-16. Rogers was scoreless for four-and-a-half minutes. Joplin’s two big men — the 6-foot-7 Hafer and 6-5 senior Terrance Gibson — combined to make 6 of 8 free throws in the second quarter alone. and Gibson had seven in the game. Joplin led 27-23 at halftime and then outscored Rogers 25-16 in the third quarter; Gibson scored nine of those points and Wright added 12. The lead grew to 55-39 when Wright made his fifth 3-pointer of the night with 7:20 remaining. Gooch scored with 2:51 left to make it a 20-point game, and senior Grayden Cravens made it 23 with a 3-pointer not long after. “The ball was moving better and we were getting driving lanes out of it,” Schaake said. “I thought our big kids were definitely in the paint. They were sealing well and going up strong, which is what we need. It opens up our guards, too. ”“Especially after last night, I didn’t know what our legs were going to be like, so I was proud to see our kids fight through fatigue and soreness,” he said. “We have potential to be a really good team on both ends of the floor with size and good guard play. We tell our guys just keep them in front and trust your help is going to be behind you. If you do that, good things are going to happen. ”Wright led all scorers with 36, giving him a total of 68 in the span of just 24 hours. Six of those came on three dunks Saturday night. Gibson scored 13, Hafer had 7, Gooch scored 4, Cravens had 3, Collis Jones and Quin Renfro each had 2, and Cooper Williams added 1. Joplin (5-2) travels to Parkview (1-5) on Tuesday. \n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo. — To simply say it’s the end of an era would be an understatement. John Roderique, who guided the Webb City football team to 13 state championships as one of the greatest coaches in Missouri history, announced on Monday that the 2022 season will be his last. He’s retiring at the end of the school year. “I’m excited (and a little sad) to announce my retirement at the end of this school year,” Roderique said in a statement released by the school. “I have loved my role as the head football coach and athletic director at Webb City High School and will cherish the friendships and memories. From the bottom of my heart — thank you all. ”Roderique, a Webb City High School graduate, took over as head coach before the 1997 season and promptly went 14-0 and won his first championship. He followed that up with titles in 2000, 2001, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2019 and 2021. In his 26 years as head coach, he compiled a record of 315 wins and just 34 losses. The Cardinals went to the playoffs 23 times during that time. Webb City won 22-straight district championships under his tenure, a streak that ended this fall. His 315 wins rank fifth all time in Missouri history, according to Missouri State High School Activities Association records. But his 90. 2 winning percentage is unmatched. Career wins leader Pete Adkins (Centralia, Jefferson City) won 87% of his games and finished with 405 total. Between 2003 and 2013, the Cardinals won 91-straight regular season games. They won 46 in a row overall between 2010 and 2013 in the midst of winning five straight state championships. Before he was a coach, Roderique was already a household name in Webb City. A 1986 graduate, he was a standout football player for the Cardinals and helped the school to its first-ever playoff appearance in 1985. They went 11-2 that season and Roderique kicked a game winning 28-yard field goal in the state quarterfinals against West Plains. Webb City claimed its first conference championship that season since 1961. After the ’85 season, Roderique became Webb City’s first All-State selection, then signed with Pittsburg State University to play linebacker. With the Gorillas from 1986-89, he was a two-time All-American linebacker who recorded 365 tackles in his career and was inducted into the PSU Athletics Hall of Fame in 1999. When his playing days were over, he joined Pitt State’s coaching staff under Chuck Broyles. Over the next seven seasons, the Gorillas won 77 games and the 1991 Division II championship. When Kurt Thompson announced he was leaving Webb City for Coffeyville Community College after the 1996 season, it was obvious who would replace him: Roderique. After winning that 1997 championship, Roderique’s Cardinals went 5-5 in 1998. That goes down as his worst season as a head coach; he never had a losing record. “Webb City Football is rooted in pride and tradition and I stand firm on the quote that ‘Great things can be accomplished when everyone works together and nobody cares who gets the credit,’” Roderique said in the press release. “This quote epitomizes the players and coaches I’ve had the opportunity to work with. God has blessed me abundantly!”Seneca Athletics Director Rich Adkins was a senior on Roderique’s 1997 team and later served as an assistant coach on his staff from 2009-11. “My first reaction is I’m happy for him,” Adkins said Monday. “I sent him a text saying congratulations. It’s been such a cool experience to watch him go through this with his record and everything and being one of the best coaches around — not only in the state but in the country. and it’s crazy for me just to know that I was kind of a part of that and at the very beginning of it. That’s always something I’ve taken a lot of pride in. ”He credited Roderique’s success in part to the coach’s relationship with people. “I think that’s the top thing, just how he learns,” he said. “He knows every kid, he knows every coach’s spouse’s name, their kid’s names, and he does a good job with people and building those relationships to where these kids and these community members want to be a part of it, they want to play for him and do whatever they can. ”\n",

      "While some City Council members believe Joplin could move forward on its own to address issues involving homelessness, the council has authorized city administrators to commission a study. A discussion on the question took place during an informal meeting of the council on Monday ahead of its formal 6 p. m. business session. Assistant City Manager Tony Robyn said that the impact of homelessness on those individuals and on the community were discussed with City Manager Nick Edwards by residents during he called a \"listening tour\" he conducted in 2020. \"Homelessness bubbled up to the surface as a priority issue that we'd like to take a closer look at, and even more appropriately, the effects of homeless through the community,\" Robyn said. City management met with staff and department heads and the Homeless Coalition about what they all would like to know if a study were conducted. Robyn asked for council input on the details that would be requested in the study if it were conducted. Councilman Phil Stinnett said he thinks the Homeless Coalition, which involves representatives of about 25 organizations that provide services for those in need, should know better than an outside consultant about the local situation and needs. \"They know it better than anyone we are going to go hire,\" Stinnett said. \"We seem to spend a ton of time and a ton of money when I see other communities grab the bulls by the horns and starting doing something,\" Stinnett said of the proposal to hire a consultant for a paid study. He said a private enterprise in Springfield started the Eden House community, which provides low-cost shelter for individuals who have no place to stay. \"They're not throwing money at a problem. They're trying to provide an answer to a problem,\" Stinnett said. \"If we just continue to try to throw money and figure that's the way, I just don't think its going to do us any good. \"Stinnett said he needed more information about what would be accomplished by paying for a study. Robyn said 20 to 25 agencies and people involved in the Homeless Coalition meet monthly and talk about needs whether it's food or housing or federal assistance. \"What they have expressed is a process where we could all come together and see what everybody is doing and see what the gaps are in those processes,\" and create a plan visualizing what we could do better. Stinnett said that's what was envisioned when homelessness was listed by the council as a priority in a city strategic plan. But he did not see why that couldn't be done with the city in the role as facilitator without spending more money on a study. Councilwoman Kate Spencer said she agreed with Stinnett's comments and says it's been talked about a lot but nothing ever happens. There is someone in Joplin trying a similar idea to Eden Village. \"To throw more money on something that should be obvious is kind of frustrating,\" she said. Keenan Cortez, mayor pro tem, said he is encouraged to see the city bringing so many organizations together. But he did not see that substance and alcohol abuse issues were addressed in the request for proposals for a study, so he wants to make sure those issues are addressed by the Homeless Coalition. Robyn said the city is not the content expert on the homeless. \"It's the 20-plus agencies around the table that are the experts,\" he said. \"We are looking for someone who knows how to put a plan together. \"Councilman Mark Farnham said the Eden House project in Springfield does not involve the city except to see it meets city codes. It provides tiny home housing for those who have limited funds for housing for people who are willing to follow the village rules. However, those who are actively drinking or using drugs are not eligible for the housing, he said. The city manager said he wanted to bring to the council a draft of a request for proposals to conduct the study to include them in the  decision process. \"One of the things we wanted to do was to allow for engagement among the providers,\" he said. \"This is to provide a forum allowing those organizations to get their ideas on the table and bring accountability. \"\"The city doesn't really have a plan,\" Edwards said. \"Our plan would be to work with the Homeless Coalition. This would give us a plan with broader voices. If this is not something the council wants, there are other things we could be working on if council wants to look at Eden Village. Really the driver of this was to have a communitywide plan and something the city could be responsible for. \"Councilman Chuck Copple asked what the city management's intent is in regard to who would run or carry out the plan on a day-to-day basis once it's finished. The city manager said he didn't know yet, \"which is why we need to go through the process. \" He thought the study would address the broad needs including housing, transit, mental health, and police activities, not just housing. \"I think the issue we're facing is we haven't been able to get everyone around a table and decide what we could do about homelessness. I think we can have a robust strategic plan come out of this. \"With that, Mayor Doug Lawson asked for a consensus and said that going by the nods of those consenting, the work to commission a study could go forward. \n",

      "With less than two minutes remaining in the game, the Joplin’s boys basketball team led visiting Lee’s Summit by eight points and appeared poised to earn its fifth win of the season. But the Tigers pulled off a stunner, outscoring Joplin 11-2 down the stretch and scoring the go-ahead basket with 10 seconds left to hand Joplin a 60-59 defeat on Friday night inside Kaminsky Gymnasium. “Our kids, they keep fighting and keep scrapping,” Lee’s Summit coach Blake Little said. “It’s one of those leads that’s uncomfortable sometimes when you’re up eight. You’re not trying to go too fast and it kind of takes you out of what you’ve been doing. They got a little conservative, which gave us a chance and so I was really proud of our guys because they kept fighting, kept fighting and got just enough stops to get over the hump. ”Joplin (4-2) led throughout the second half and had a 57-49 advantage with 2:18 remaining after All Wright made a free throw. But the Eagles’ next three possessions resulted in a turnover, a jump ball and a missed 1-and-1 opportunity. Joplin didn’t make a field goal in the final 4:55 of the game. The visitors (1-3) cut into that eight-point lead with a 3-pointer at the 1:46 mark and had it down to 57-55 with 1:08 left. Two free throws by Joplin’s Quin Renfro with 46 seconds on the clock got it back to four, but Lee’s Summit answered with another 3-pointer and then forced a Joplin turnover in the paint. A basket by Elijah Martinez with 10 seconds to go was the difference. Joplin missed a contested layup in the waning seconds and time expired while players battled for the loose ball. After some deliberation, officials ruled it a jump ball and gave Joplin a chance to inbound it with 1. 5 seconds on the clock. Renfro threw it in to Wright but his jumper at the buzzer didn’t fall. “I think we were pretty good guarding them,” Little said. “Man, All Wright’s incredible. He’s a great player and we just kept running at him and running at him and made enough plays on him, made him work just hard enough. and we didn’t foul him in the second half so that gave us a chance. They weren’t at the foul line as much and that gave us a chance. ”Wright had a game-high 32 points but was limited to three attempts at the line in the fourth quarter after making 8 of 9 in the first half. Joplin made 12 of 15 free throws in the first half and 6 of 9 in the second. Whit Hafer was second in scoring with eight, and the trio of Terrance Gibson, Renfro and Fred Taylor each added five. Martinez, who turned in three highlight-worthy dunks in the first half, led the Tigers with 24. \n",

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  Joplin High School Junior Aidan Koch has earned a perfect score of 36 on the ACT. Joplin Schools announced the accomplishment today. Koch has been a student of Joplin Schools since kindergarten. He credits some of his success to extra testing preparation and a positive mental attitude, but also recognizes the ongoing support of his educators. Almost every teacher Ive had at JHS has taught me something different, and not just in an academic sense but also about life and the way I want to live it, said Koch. My teachers have gone above and beyond in preparing me for life outside the classroom, and for that I will be forever indebted. Also, I have never had a teacher who didnt believe in his or her students and adamantly desire their students success; that source of encouragement and support was and is a vital part of my success, both in and out of the classroom. Aidan is an outstanding young man, said Joplin High School principal Dr. Steve Gilbreth. He is so talented in so many areas. He participates in many activities, and he has some great dance moves!

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  Joplin City Council considered a Special Use Permit for a residence that holds House Concerts at 2120 East 24th Street in Joplin. The Special Use Permit was requested by the resident, Jeff Morrow. 2120 E 24th is a private residence on the SW corner of 24th and Delaware. They hold house concerts inside this 1900 square foot home hosting about 30 people at a time in the living room according to homeowner and music-lover Jeff Morrow. Google Street View date unknown. The council chambers were standing-room-only as supporters of the Coda Concert House attended. Morrow spoke to council informing them of the outline of their house concerts that feature world-class musicians. He then answered questions from council members regarding parking, portable restrooms etc. Morrow addressed the issue of serving alcohol beforehand stating they do not serve food or alcohol. But those in attendance can bring their own. They have never had any issues he said.  The city has been aware of the Coda Concert House since 2017, City of Joplins Troy Bolander stated at the hearing on Monday evening, December 5, 2022.  Bolander said staff had reviewed the Special Use Permit and recommended to grant 2-year special use permit. SPECIAL USE PERMIT OUTLINE: Councilman Charles Copple proposed one addendum to the permit, that annual fire inspections be made, even though Bolander said there were no restrictions since it was a private residence. Council voted to add the fire inspection to the permit. Numerous supporters spoke to the council supporting the concerts. One council member was overheard on a hot mic during a break that this crowd was as large as the crowds who attended the mask mandate council meetings.  A handful of neighbors opposing the special use permit spoke. One man towards the end of the hearing stated, I love music, I love concerts. I also love Wal-Mart, but I dont want one in my backyard. In the end the Special Use Permit was granted for two years. It was approved by all council members.

PREVIOUS STORY: Community comes together to pay final respects to fallen JPD officer Corporal Benjamin Cooper In memory of the September 11th attacks, the Tunnel to Towers Foundations Fallen First Responder program pays off mortgages for the families of law enforcement officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty and leave behind young children. The program ensures those children will always have a place to call home.  You can read the full release from Tunnel to Towers below: Tunnel to Towers honors the service and sacrifice of Joplin Police Corporal Benjamin Cooper In honor of the anniversary of the September 11th attacks, the Tunnel to Towers Foundation has paid, in full, the mortgage on the home of a slain Joplin Police Corporal Benjamin Cooper. On March 8, 2022, Police Corporal Cooper was shot and killed in the line of duty after responding to a disturbance call at a shopping center. Corporal Cooper spent his entire life serving his country and community. He enlisted in the Army after graduating high school and served his country for eight years. Following his military service, he returned home and joined the Joplin Police Department in 2003. He then served as a Sheriffs Deputy in Colorado for a number of years before returning to the Joplin Police Department in 2013. Cooper was an avid outdoorsman who loved to bow hunt and fish. Family meant everything to him and he enjoyed nothing more than spending time with his loved ones. Police Corporal Benjamin Cooper is survived by his wife, Roxanne, and his two daughters, Tiffany and Ashley. The Tunnel to Towers Foundations Fallen First Responder Program pays off mortgages for the families of law enforcement officers and firefighters who are killed in the line of duty and leave behind young children, ensuring that they will always have a place to call home. In 2021, Tunnel to Towers expanded the program to support the families of first responders who have lost their lives to 9/11 illnesses. When America was attacked on September 11, 2001, my brother and so many others rushed headfirst into danger and laid down their lives, trying to save as many people as they could. Twenty-one years later, I am proud to keep my brother Stephens memory alive by supporting the families of these heroes who have also sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. Their dedication and their sacrifice will never be forgotten, and the families they left behind will always have the support of Tunnel to Towers, said Tunnel to Towers Foundation Chairman & CEO Frank Siller.

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  A local physician pleads guilty in federal court to health care fraud. U. S. Attorney Teresa Moores office released information about the plea today. Prosecutors say 55-year-old Heather D. Stelling provided false information to get Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Authorities say she was not entitled to those reimbursements. Heather D. Stelling, 55, waived her right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U. S. Chief Magistrate Judge David P. Rush to a federal information that charges her with one count of making a false statement relating to health care, states Moores Office. Federal Agents seize records in a warrant service at Stelling Pain Management, LLC in February of 2019, 3200 block of S Ferguson. Shannon Becker file photo. Stelling was a pain management physician who owned and operated Stelling Pain Management, LLC, in Joplin. According to todays plea agreement, Stelling continued to practice medicine from Sept. 12 to Sept. 24, 2018, despite believing that her medical license was suspended during that time. Under state law, a Missouri licensed physician who fails to file or fails to pay any Missouri state tax for three years, shall have their license suspended. The Missouri Department of Revenue erroneously informed Missouris Board of Registration for the Healing Arts that Stelling had failed to file and/or pay state income taxes. Stelling was informed that, in order to avoid having her license suspended, she needed to obtain a certificate of tax compliance from the Department of Revenue by Sept. 12, 2018, which she failed to do. Stellings license to practice medicine was erroneously suspended on Sept. 12, 2018.  U. S. Attorneys Office On Sept. 24, 2018, the Department of Revenue provided the Board of Registration for the Healing Arts with a certificate of tax compliance, Stellings license was reinstated, and her suspension was subsequently expunged. Thats according to Prosecutors. Investigators say Stelling knew that Medicare and Medicaid would not pay claims for services rendered to beneficiaries while her license was suspended. In order to receive payment, she billed Medicare and Medicaid for services rendered to beneficiaries while she believed her license was suspended by falsely claiming dates of service outside the period of her suspension. Stelling was accused of altering the dates of service in her patients records to conceal that the service had been rendered when she believed her license was suspended. Stelling altered at least 24 of her patient records to make it appear as though she had not treated the patient during the time that she believed her medical license was suspended. Stelling billed Medicare and Medicaid for these services, knowing that the services were supported, in part, by false statements she had made in the patients records.  Moores Office As a result of Stellings conduct, Medicare and MO HealthNet (Missouris Medicaid program) paid a total of $146,026 in claims they otherwise would not have paid. Under the terms of todays plea agreement, Stelling must pay $127,750 in restitution to Medicare and $18,276 in restitution to MO HealthNet. Under federal statutes, Stelling is subject to a sentence of up to five years in federal prison without parole. The U. S. Attorneys office in Western Missouri says the maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U. S. Attorneys Shannon T. Kempf and Casey Clark. It was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Missouri Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. \n",

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  The NCAA says Missouri Southern State and the former head football coach committed multiple violations over two years. In a release of its findings today, the NCAA states MSSU, failed to monitor its football program, which committed multiple NCAA violations over two academic years, including impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, academic misconduct and violations of countable athletically related activities, according to an agreement released by the Division II Committee on Infractions. A former football assistant coach also violated ethical conduct rules and did not cooperate with an NCAA investigation. The alleged violations of the former football head coach include: The university and the enforcement staff used ranges identified by the Division II membership-approved infractions penalty guidelines to agree upon the following penalties: According to the NCAA, after reviewing the head coachs case, the committee also prescribed the following penalty: Missouri Southern State University released a statement today about the investigation findings. Today, as we move forward, Missouri Southern is committed to a highly competitive NCAA Division II athletics program that supports a great student-athlete experience and prioritizes achieving these goals within a culture of compliance, said Dr. Dean Van Galen, MSSU President since July 2020. While these circumstances are unfortunate, particularly because the violations occurred prior to Coach Bradleys arrival, we are pleased to have this matter resolved so that we can continue to focus on the positive progress of our football program, said Mallory. I have 100% confidence that under Coach Bradleys leadership that Lions football is operating with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. MSSU states no current MSSU employees were implicated in this investigation. You can read the full releases from the NCAA and MSSU below. Missouri Southern State failed to monitor its football program, which committed multiple NCAA violations over two academic years, including impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, academic misconduct and violations of countable athletically related activities, according to an agreement released by the Division II Committee on Infractions. A former football assistant coach also violated ethical conduct rules and did not cooperate with an NCAA investigation. (PDF Version) The former football head coach violated head coach responsibility rules and ethical conduct rules when he failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance with NCAA rules and was directly involved in violations, according to a decision released by the committee. He failed to monitor his staffs involvement in student-athletes academics after threatening staff jobs if student-athletes failed to perform academically, and he engaged in unethical conduct when he did not meet his obligation to cooperate with an investigation and denied involvement in the violations. This case used different resolution paths. The school and the former academic advisor agreed to the violations and penalties and resolved their case through a negotiated resolution. The former assistant coach did not participate in the investigation, and his violations and penalties were uncontested. The former head coach contested the violations but ultimately stopped participating in the infractions process. The committee considered his violations on the written record. The university, former academic advisor and enforcement staff agreed that the advisor provided impermissible recruiting inducements and impermissible benefits on multiple occasions. The advisor had existing relationships with two student-athletes from her previous job. The first student-athlete lived cost-free at the advisors home for several months prior to his enrollment at Missouri Southern State, amounting to approximately $2,000 in impermissible inducements. The advisor also paid an outstanding tuition bill of approximately $1,500 from his previous school, which allowed him to enroll at Missouri Southern State. The advisor later paid a $500 bail fee for another student-athlete who had been arrested while enrolled at the school. Even though both student-athletes ultimately repaid the advisor, the benefits violated NCAA rules. The committee also determined that an additional violation involving recruiting inducements occurred when, after being hired by Missouri Southern State, the former football head coach began recruiting a community college student-athlete who had played for the coach at his previous school. That prospect had an outstanding tuition bill at his prior school, and as a result the college would not release his transcripts so he could transfer. The head coach arranged for a booster to pay that tuition bill, which amounted to more than $8,000. The payment constitutes an impermissible recruiting inducement, and the head coachs direct involvement violated ethical conduct rules. The prospect later enrolled and competed in eight contests, receiving actual and necessary expenses associated with those competitions, while ineligible. The school and the enforcement staff agreed that during two consecutive summers, the football coaching staff required student-athletes to participate in captains practices, which involved athlete-led drills and seven-on-seven activities. Those practices were scheduled to accommodate training, summer classes and job schedules for student-athletes, and were directed and observed by members of the coaching staff, resulting in the program exceeding the allowed countable athletics-related activity. The head coach later admitted he was aware of the practices. Additionally, the school and the enforcement staff agreed that the former assistant coach pressured an enrolled student-athlete to complete coursework for a prospect. The assistant coach threatened to withhold the student-athletes scholarship if he did not complete the online courses and strictly advised him not to speak to anyone about that arrangement. The committee concluded that the head coach failed to monitor his staffs involvement in student-athletes academics after he threated their jobs if student-athletes failed to perform, noting that as a result of these threats, an assistant coach engaged in academic misconduct. The committee also determined that the head coach did not promote an atmosphere for compliance. In its decision, the committee stated, [H]e personally created an environment where the athletics leadership and compliance were considered the enemy and used fear and intimidation with his staff members to further that divide. His approach was the antithesis of a compliant program[. ] The school and enforcement staff agreed that Missouri Southern State failed to monitor its football program. While the school was aware of the tensions between the football program and the athletics department, the school did not enforce the reporting structure with the football head coach or his staff. Finally, the head coach engaged in unethical conduct when he did not meet his obligation to cooperate with an investigation. In addition to providing demonstrably false or misleading information to investigators, the head coach did not agree to violations and penalties in the negotiated resolution with the school and academic advisor but did not respond to the staffs subsequent notice of allegations or multiple requests for a response from the Committee on Infractions. The university and the enforcement staff used ranges identified by the Division II membership-approved infractions penalty guidelines to agree upon the following penalties: After reviewing the head coachs case, the committee also prescribed the following penalty: Members of the Committee on Infractions are drawn from NCAA member schools and conferences and members of the public. The committee members who reviewed this case are Jessica Chapin, director of athletics at American International; David Hansburg, director of athletics at Colorado School of Mines; John David Lackey, attorney; Richard Loosbrock, faculty athletics representative at Adams State; Melissa Reilly, associate commissioner at the East Coast Conference; Leslie Schuemann, senior woman administrator/deputy commissioner at the Great Midwest Athletic Conference; and Jason Sobolik, assistant athletics director for compliance and student services at Minnesota State University Moorhead. The NCAA Committee on Infractions has announced its findings after an investigation into actions of the Missouri Southern State University football program that occurred in 2019 and 2020. Missouri Southern State University, a proud member of the NCAA Division II and the MIAA, has a history of supporting exemplary academic and athletic programs while adhering to the rules of its governing body. The university routinely and thoroughly investigates all potential violations of NCAA or MIAA rules and self-reports in a timely manner when it is determined that violations have occurred. The athletic department implements regular compliance education for all coaches and staff. When university NCAA compliance staff was notified of potential violations in July 2020, an internal investigation was conducted, which resulted in self-reporting to the NCAA in October 2020. The university has since worked collaboratively with NCAA enforcement staff on its investigation and has agreed to a fair resolution of the violations that occurred in 2019 and 2020. MSSU fully concurs with NCAA enforcement and the Committee on Infractions regarding this negotiated resolution. The university appreciated the assistance and diligence of the enforcement staff for working closely throughout the investigation process. Since the time of the violations, both the football program and athletic department are under new leadership, with the arrival of Head Football Coach Atiba Bradley in February 2021 and Director of Athletics Rob Mallory in July 2021. No current MSSU employees were implicated in this investigation. Today, as we move forward, Missouri Southern is committed to a highly competitive NCAA Division II athletics program that supports a great student-athlete experience and prioritizes achieving these goals within a culture of compliance, said Dr. Dean Van Galen, MSSU President since July 2020. While these circumstances are unfortunate, particularly because the violations occurred prior to Coach Bradleys arrival, we are pleased to have this matter resolved so that we can continue to focus on the positive progress of our football program, said Mallory. I have 100% confidence that under Coach Bradleys leadership that Lions football is operating with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. \n",

Joplin E-911 alerted the Joplin Fire Dept to respond. Joplin Fire arrival observed smoke coming from the eaves and roof of the residence.  Joplin Police tell us on scene there was no sign of forced entry. We never observed visible flames from outside the residence. Neighbors tell us it is vacant, the owners had fixed the home up for sale and the for sale sign is clearly posted in the front yard. Liberty Utilities responded to cut electric from the residence. Smoke almost immediately began subsiding. Joplin Fire will have official information as it becomes available. But for now it appears it was electrical within the walls and ceiling.

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  Petro, Flying J, and Loves theyre all popular spots to stop for truckers on a long haul across the country. Joplin has its fair share, a number that is growing. You know, when you think about trying to park you know, 60-70 foot long truck, you just cant do that anywhere, said Greg Orr, CFI President. Just one of the challenges for a trucker on a long haul. They need to eat. But many times the rig may need repairs or the driver a shower not something every gas station offers.  When you think about today, across the United States, we dont have enough truck stops or parking for a lot of our drivers, said Orr. But there will soon be a new option in the Joplin area. Construction is underway on a future Road Ranger truck stop at Exit 13 on Interstate 44. It will sit just across Prigmor Avenue to the east of the existing Big Apple Travel Center. Theyre like any other business. You know, you go down the road. You see a lot of auto dealerships right next to each other. Theres advantages to certain locations and regardless of the competition, they know thats going to be a good spot for them and a lot of people are going to stop in that area, said Travis Stephens, Joplin Chamber. Advantages like the number of cars and trucks passing by on I-44, more than 40,000 a day. The site is Just a couple of miles from Flying J and Quik Trip on the east side of Joplin, and theres also Petro and Loves on the west side of town. Joplins Chamber of Commerce president says theres a reason there are so many nearby. I think its the natural location of our proximity to two major interstates where I ride it across even another state into another state. Theres a lot of advantages for transportation truck stops, that sort of thing,said Stephens. Stephens adds the addition is good for truckers and good for the local economy. So the great thing about these truck stops are that a lot of people driving down the highway will stop. Theyll get their snacks, some drink, some gas, and then theyre on their way and they leave behind a little bit of tax revenue for the residents of Joplin. Without ever having to need any of the job and services. So its definitely a plus for the community, he said. \n",

While out-of-state residents can buy fireworks here all year round, Missouri residents can only do so around the 4th of July and New Years. Aaron Colson is the owner of Black Market Fireworks. His superstore is open all year round, while two other locations North Main Street, just south of the city of Airport Drive and West 7th Street, near Tri-State Road will be open the day after Christmas through January first. And he says mother nature generally determines how sales go during the holiday season. Its always weather dependent, if we have 50 degrees on New Years Eve or a couple of days before New Years, we have a good selling season. If its bad weather predicted or theres a lot of wind or weve had a drought and obviously everything is dormant, then its really not so good, its never really even close to the season we get for the 4th of July, said Colson. \n",

      "WEBB CITY, Mo.  It was a chilly night for Southwest Missouris last Christmas parade of the holiday season. However, the cold didnt stop people from attending the Webb City Christmas parade tonight (12/14). 52 entries, including Santa, made their way North along Main Street in downtown Webb City. One of the parade floats was from a literacy promotion program called Webb City Reads. Last year the group made their first appearance in the citys annual Christmas parade, but instead of handing out candy, they gave out donated books 500 to be exact. Before reaching the end of the parade route, the books were all but gone. This year, however, the group came prepared. 1,500 books were handed out, all for free, to those watching the parade. Webb City Reads had enough books on hand to finish out tonights parade. Candy is totally dispensable and its just going to last you a few moments of joy, but a book you can enjoy for the rest of your life, said Mary Sears with Webb City Reads. I work at the Webster Library here and we know how important it is to get books in the hands of kids so, the kids were super excited to get books for all different reading levels that were passed out during the parade tonight, said Webb City paradegoer, Mary Jo Smith.

Dress for the weather; out there on the prairie theres not much wind block, so be sure to wear a coat, hat, whatevers going to keep you warm. And some binoculars if you have them because they could be off in the distance and we want to make sure we get a good look, said Kensi Tillman, Naturalist, Missouri Department of Conservation.

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  One Joplin resident who happens to be a big fan of the Christmas season, took a different approach when it came to decorating for the holiday. In Dustin Molinaros front yard, youll find plenty of Christmas decorations, but theyre slightly older than what you might be use to seeing. Walking up to his home, youll find more than 200 blow mold style Christmas yard decorations. His collection started over 20 years ago, when his grandparents handed down some of their vintage Christmas decorations. Since then, Molinaro searches garage sales, markets, eBay, and the Facebook Marketplace where hes finds the old fashioned decorations. This year, Molinaro began putting up the unique Christmas figures just after Halloween, and spent the entire month of November placing them in just the right spot. Its kind of just like my Christmas tradition at this point. Starting off when I was eight, getting my first ones, every time I would see them in someones yard it just brings a smile to my face because thats what I grew up with, so its just really my family tradition, said Dustin Molinaro. Molinaro says his neighbors love the Christmas set-up. Because of the display, traffic near his home (located near West 15th Street and South Moffet Avenue in Joplin) increases each night as drivers slowly pass by to get a glimpse of the special Christmas collection. \n",

      "JOPLIN, Mo. (KSNF-KODE) Christmas is just right around the corner, and that often means falling into routine get-togethers with family and friends. The definition of tradition is the transmission of customs or beliefs from generation to generation or the fact of being passed on this way. Traditions provide a connection for families or friends. While there are cherished traditions that everyone looks forward to, there are also traditions that have started falling by the wayside.  There are many reasons traditions end. It can be something definitive (a death, divorce, a move) or something less concrete. Or a tradition may run its course and not work over time as lives change or people get older. Sometimes a tradition ends because the joy it once brought has faded. Some of the most beloved past times have become things of the past, as modern practices take their place. Here are some holiday traditions that become less important with each passing year. Unfortunately, most of these forgotten traditions revolve around spending more quality time with your family. Holiday dcor began arriving in stores long before we reached the peek of fall. Waiting to decorate for the December holidays until he actual month of December arrives, seems a thing of the past. And it seems any warm day from Halloween onward will find homeowners stringing lights and setting up elaborate displays. When making a trip into town, youll likely find that many big box stores begin decorating for Christmas before we celebrate Thanksgiving. A big family gathering served on paper plates? Welcome to holiday gatherings in the 21st century. Pulling out the finest china, using the treasured silver, creating a table that shows how much you care, all are holiday traditions that are falling away. Along those same lines, you may be serving guests who arrive in jeans and sweatshirts. Its a rare family that insists on (and enjoys) putting on a suit and tie or dress for the familys most celebrated meals of the year. Its rare to see anyone caroling through the neighborhood anymore. Most holiday singing happens in church, at community tree-lightings, at malls, or in schools. No more knocking, singing. A needle, some thread, freshly popped popcorn, and some fresh cranberries are all the makings of a fun family tradition. Today, hand-strung popcorn garland is a rarity; perhaps as rare as a home that has a needle and thread. Sharing greetings by snail mail. Many no longer keep up the tradition and opt for e-greetings. Also, its more unlikely to find those who write their own cards out by hand. However, itsbeen reportedthat millennials like to send cards and could be supporting a revival of this tradition. TheAmerican Christmas Tree Association reportsthat while 77% of U. S. households will celebrate this holiday season with a Christmas tree, a staggering 82% of those displayed will be artificial trees. Theres just something about the smell of fresh pine that brings some Holiday cheer, despite the fact that we will again be vacuuming up pine needles for months. Long gone are the days outdoor holiday dcor was simple, when just a few people would outline their entryway or roofline with a strand of big outdoor bulbs or just a front-door wreath. Today, its all about hundreds of twinkling fairy lights, icicle lights, blow-up figures, and competitions. Remember your elementary school days? You had to get a present at a particular price. The entire class put their gifts in one big bag, and when your turn came, you felt around for something that felt good. Maybe some years you got a doll, while others you got McDonalds gift certificates. Today, it seems like its all about Secret Santa and shopping for someone you know. CNBC reportedthat online shopping was outpacing brick-and-mortar shopping and for many who are short on time (and patience),shopping for the holidays onlineis a welcome option. But dont you miss having grabbing something warm to drink while you walk through the nearest mall, or make your way up and down Main Street gathering one gift after another? Can you remember the arrival of theSears Wish Book? It was a mega-catalog that fueled many childhood daydreams (and likely a letter to Santa). Sometimes, the catalogs delivery would bring about a fight with your brothers and sisters over who got to pore over its countless pages first. Today, while many companies still send out catalogs, they are often samplings with notations throughout to find more online. People magazineshared a storyabout people opting to skip gifts altogether, and instead, spending time with family over a holiday meal. Especially now, as inflation causes the price of nearly everything to rise, buying gifts are not as important as it once was. A tree with winding train tracks underneath or a room or basement filled with a whole holiday train village was the tradition in many households. Today, its a rarity and is mainly found only in with very elaborate commercial decorating. I made it myself is rarely heard during the holiday season anymore. For many, long gone are the days when your holiday gift list included knitting a scarf for your mom, sewing a shirt for your dad, or crafting a necklace for your sister. Youll find that most millennials have never sewn in their life. After the holidays, extending the warm feelings with heartfelt thank-you notes puts a very nice finishing touch on the season as a whole. Today, were lucky if we get a text. You can find even more classic Christmas traditions from the past, HERE. When it comes to holiday traditions, we wanted to hear from our readers/viewers. On KSNs Living Well with Gary Bandy and Shelby Neely, their recent Question of the Day was, Whats your favorite Christmas tradition and/or memory?

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  Many MoDOT crews have been keeping a close eye on road conditions since early yesterday morning. We spoke with MoDOT District Maintenance Engineer, Darin Hamelink, today who says crews are currently putting a focus on cleaning up intersections, passing lanes, and turn lanes on places like Range Line Road and 7th Street in Joplin. Theyre also working to clear rural roads like Highways 37 and 60 with plows and ice-clearing products. But depending on how cold it is those products dont always work. And if its not sticking, if the precips not sticking to the road, we can just plow it off and kind of let the cold temperatures help us when we can. And we did have some routes that were clear because of that, and we had other ones that it stuck down on us, and we just werent able to get it off, said Hamelink. Hamelink also says they had 4 trucks rear-ended yesterday, resulting in one worker being injured. Drivers are reminded to not follow those trucks too closely. MoDOT also has an online travel map, which stays up-to-date with road conditions. You can check that out by following this link here. \n",

Officers with JPD responded to a domestic assault call Wednesday shortly before 4:00 PM in the 400 block of S.

Carthage voters turned down the question earlier this year, but district leaders are considering a second try in April. They point out it the benefit would extend beyond a new performance space.

A community presentation hosted by Russ Tuttle, President and Founder of the Stop Trafficking Project, took place in the gymnasium of Diamond Elementary. The adult-only seminar covered many aspects of domestic minor sex trafficking, including how the internet and social networking apps have made it simple for kids and teens to hide their conversations and activities from others. Those who attended were shown examples of how easy it is for our youth to become involved in trafficking. Attendees were also taught ways to identify the many different signs of trafficking, and were given the tools to help keep students safe. The message is not for our kids to be afraid when online, the message is to have a proper understanding that when youre online, we need you to be a hero and we need you to watch for certain patterns so you can keep yourself safer and kids that you care about, safer as well, said Russ Tuttle, President and Founder of the Stop Trafficking Project.

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  As the new year gets closer a lot of people make resolutions to lose weight. But keeping a resolution is much harder than making one. Experts say your focus should not be on a number. So what I would recommend is not focusing on a number, but focus on you know, looking at habits and maybe even evaluating whats the reason you want to lose weight, said Susan Pittman, Freeman, Program Coordinator for Diabetes Education. Susan Pittman with Freeman Health System recommends setting behavioral goals. We really recommend just looking at more behaviors and setting them as a goal versus a true number for a weight loss goal, said Pittman. She says fasting is often a route chosen to lose weight, but may not be the best choice. My concern with that would be that its eliminating time where you need to be fueling your body. So we recommend that when youre up and about doing work, school, exercise, that you need fuel for your body, she said. For the next year, Pittman suggests that you reflect on the positive. So I think with New Years thinking of it as what maybe even reflecting on whats working really well. So evaluate like in the past year, what have I done well. And then looking towards the new year, what are some habits that maybe would benefit me, Pittman said. She says just because youre eating less, doesnt mean youre getting healthier. So what we dont want to see is restriction that is extreme. And so if were eating in moderation, were getting the nourishment to our body that the body needs. But what happens sometimes is we think less is better. And so we have people really cutting back skipping one meal and then maybe skipping two meals, maybe even three and that is very stressful and very harmful to the body, she adds. \n",

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  New Years Eve is a time of year synonymous with champagne and wine. But it you havent purchased your favorite brand yet, depending upon where its from, you might be in for a rude awakening. Like almost everything else, the cost of American-made wine and sparkling liquor has increased slightly throughout 2022 at roughly the rate of inflation. But the same cant be said for foreign produced beverages of the same type. Price increase anywhere from 20 to 50 percent, shipping costs have gone up, production costs have gone up, by getting labor, people to fix it, but getting the product itself into the store has been really hard, said LaNetta Lewis, Manager, Jugz Liquor & Microbrew. And Lewis says she doesnt think the price hike and availability of those beverages will change away anytime soon. Foreign wines are gonna still get harder and harder to get and distributors are gonna have more and more trouble getting them, getting them off the shipping containers has been a nightmare, getting them to the middle of the country has also been a nightmare, were not on a port where its going to be close, our distributors are in the middle of the country, they got a long way to go before they get here, said Lewis. But Lewis says the same thing can be said for all types of foreign produced liquor, not just wine and champagne. And to add to that, a drought in wine producing countries abroad. She says its a golden opportunity for domestic as well as Four State area producers. Youve seen an uptick in the number of local wineries that are able to produce a really good product. We push a lot of the local wineries, we want them to succeed. They make wines just as good as some of the imported. So youre gonna see a lot more of the smaller wineries expand to fill in the gap where imports arent, said Lewis. \n",

Event organizers say this is an excellent idea as another way to decorate your tree, besides those store-bought ornaments. It also provides some fun with material you might not expect to be used. For the recycling aspect of our ornaments, one of our ornaments, weve got a little birdhouse. It is recycled paper towel tubes, so we just cut them in half, in fours depending on how big the tube is, and then we utilize those again. We recycle things like trees that are going to be down out there. While this time of year, people are using them for firewood. Were also using them for ornaments for families to use for years to come. Were utilizing pine cones to make our little owls with.

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  Two historical pieces of Joplin open up to the community, despite still being under construction. What we want to do is to tell the story of these two families, said Brad Belk, Director of Joplin Historical Neighborhoods, Inc. Around 50 people showed up to tour Joplins famous Schifferdecker house (and the Zelleken house next door) on Saturday. Edward and Margaret Zelleken Home and the Charles and Wilhelmina Schifferdecker Homes, were built in the 1890s, said Belk. The two historic structures have been undergoing the renovation process over the past several years. They were business associates, and they moved over. They were in Baxter Springs, they moved to Joplin, Missouri, and they decided that theyd like to have, build two houses, and be next-door neighbors. And, indeed they were, said Belk. Those overseeing the restoration of the homes wanted to give people a look at the progress. So, you kind of come and see where it is right now, and then, hopefully, when we get open, youll want to come back. And then you can say, oh I remember that that was that, and that type of thing, said Belk. I wanted to see the work they were doing, and Im anxious to get it done because Im just excited that theyre taking history and making it beautiful again, said Coco Chickering-Berry, Tour Participant. No end-of-construction date has been released to the public. But, the hope is to tell the community about its history and get a better understanding of how the two families, who immigrated from Germany, impacted the city of Joplin They bought a lot of lead and zinc mining land. And, with that, they leased the land and got royalties from that. So, they were land barons first, and then they got involved in banks and city parks, you name it. They are very much intertwined in our community, said Belk Once done, regular tours will be available to the public. And the two families legacies will live on through these homes. The idea of younger people getting interested in our past, its essential. They need to know the foundation of why were here and the importance of that. And, sometimes its a little better to learn the experience by walking through and being able to be immersed in this environment, said Belk. My mom used to say she was Helen Chickering, she was big in Joplins history. And she always said if you dont know where youve been, you wont know where youre going, said Chickering-Berry. \n",

It might be worth your while to visit more than just relatives this time of year. Why? Because on average, youll be paying less for a hotel room. Once the thermometer drops, Jina Scott, General Manager of the Townplace Suites by Marriott in Joplin, says so does the cost of hotel rooms. We have what you call peak times and non-peak times so usually summertime we have more travelers so rates are usually higher, said Scott. In fact, according to Hotels. com, the absolute lowest hotel room rates occur between December 15th through the 20th and from January 3rd through the 8th, saving as much as 50 to $100 per night compared to summer months. Its a very good time to travel. This is usually the time we try to travel, our team members travel as well, Scott added. And there are other advantages to hitting the open road this time of year. The cool thing about traveling this time of year is youre not competing with everybody else, if youre trying to avoid large groups because of flu, COVID, whatever, this is a good time of year to go see things, said Patrick Tuttle, Director, Joplin Convention & Visitors Bureau. During those peak travel times that coincide with warm weather, Scott says you absolutely should make room accommodation plans in advance, but with fewer travelers on the road this time of year, she says thats not always a must. \n",

Around the holidays, youre gonna see a big increase especially to the main thoroughfares through town, said JPD Captain Will Davis. In fact, Joplin police have seen 130 car wrecks in just the last three weeks. December is traditionally one of the top months for crashes and marks the ninth traffic death for the year. And so you know, one is too much. And so nine is is, you know, unacceptable for us. And so anything that we can do that our officers can do to go out there and help with traffic enforcement and trying to make the roadway safer, said Davis. Officers say crashes are most often caused by a failure to yield to traffic, following another vehicle too closely, or distracted driving. They add wrecks can happen at any spot in town, but there are certain areas that are riskier. The major intersections your, your seventh and Rangeline, 32nd and Range Line, 32nd and main, 32nd and Connecticut. Those are going to be really, uh, you know, some higher crash locations. And so, you know, youre probably going to see an uptick in in police officer presence around those areas and again, throughout town, as we try to, you know, do our traffic enforcement duties, he said. And if you need another reason to watch out there will be more traffic enforcement. We want to make sure our roadways are safe for for all the drivers out there. So youre gonna see an increase in traffic stops, youre gonna see a lot of increase in traffic enforcement. And again, its just we want to make sure that everybody gets to where theyre going safely, Davis added. \n",

A consumer planning a leisure vacation with a travel advisor is likely to save three to $400 dollars on that booking. Versus them doing it themselves, Mayer added. And if youre having trouble deciding where to travel, thats another way travel agents can help. I think from a standpoint of destinations that I know a lot want to go to, because weve sent them there over the years and were going to continue to send them there. Weknow Alaska every summer is just a fantastic destination, he said. Mayer says booking with a travel agency will give you a lifeline in case of any problems you may face. We are an easy phone call or text message away when youre traveling. That we can usually get in and intervene and give you hey this is what you need to do or heres thenext solution or let me book you a hotel. So that you dont have to sleep in the airport. Local travel agents say more people are planning to travel this year, which could have you digging deeper into your pocketbook. As we see travel is impacted by the demand, the prices are impacted by the demand, and demand is high. And so, in general terms, were probably going to see higher pricesfor 23 in most general terms than what we saw in 22. But theres still value out there, planning in advance helps, said Mayer. \n",

Through some snow, ice, and subzero wind chills the occupation is even tougher. So how do firefighters stay warm this time of year when theyre fighting blazes? Well, they bring extra equipment with them, an extra hood, and an extra pair of gloves. Layer ourselves with some thermal of course underneath and try and keep our uniforms, spare uniforms, spare gloves that are dry so you can replace them when theyre wet. When youre fighting a fire, unfortunately, youre gonna get wet, Burrow added. /promo When possible, Coats says he tries to cycle his firefighters in and out of the elements on a twenty-minute basis. Newton County Ambulance in our area brings what they call a rehab trailer that has a heater in it and were able to cycle our firefighters in and out of that heated trailer to keep them from getting hypothermia or becoming hypothermic, said Coats.  And there are other occupational hazards to contend with when you use water to extinguish a blaze. The water turns into ice so we have to watch our footing, sometimes were up on a roof and so we have to watch it there so we dont slip and fall.

Its nothing new for volunteers with the Wildcat Glades Friends Group to pick up trash in Wildcat Park. Michael Poiry, for one, was surprised to say the least when they started adding it up. We maintain five different trash cans to try and pick up trash off the beach, off the creek so it doesnt end up in our water supply. This year we have accumulated a little over three tons of trash and disposed of, we have picked up about 300 pounds of aluminum cans, Poiry said. He says the proceeds from those recycled cans go toward funding the cost of educational classes offered by the group. That total is for the whole year, he was even more surprised to learn how much there was in just one week last summer, the Fourth of July. On Tuesday, we went down and recovered oh gosh, 8 or I think it was like 8 or 10 full bags of trash and we recovered something like 95 pounds of aluminum cans believe it or not, he added. So how did they come up with those figures? We take a full trash can, we weigh that, and then we calculate the number of sacks throughout the year, often times every Tuesday morning well go through all the disposal areas, down there, the beach, the bluff, up there by the Castle Heights, and well calculate the number of sacks and then do a rough estimate on how much trash we pick up, Poiry said. So why is the organization so adamant about keeping trash out of Shoal Creek? That body of water just happens to be the primary source of drinking water for residents of Joplin. \n",

Cox Monett Hospital has met the standards to be upgraded from a Level IV stroke center to a Level III certified stroke facility.  While the decision to apply for a stroke center designation is a voluntary one, the upgrade in levels speaks volumes for our team members who want to provide the fastest and highest quality of care for our community. As a Level III stroke center, we can now provide inpatient care for some stroke patients with the close collaboration of neurologists at a Level I stroke center, such as Cox South in Springfield, Missouri, says Dr. Megan Carter, Medical Director of the Cox Monett Emergency Department. The Time Critical Diagnosis (TCD) system was created in 2013 through the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Its a statewide emergency medical care response system aimed at providing faster response and quality care when a time-critical emergency happens. The goal is to create consistent, statewide rules and regulations to help EMS, EMTs, and hospital personnel ensure patients are being transported and treated by the most appropriate facility for their needs.  The TCD system implements four levels of hospital designation across the state, with Level I considered the highest based on services offered. Once a hospital completes the rigorous process to become a designated stroke center, hospitals are then required to meet strict state guidelines and undergo a survey every four years.  Cox Monett Hospital became one of the first designated Level IV stroke centers in Southwest Missouri in 2013. Its important to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke.

Well, for a lot of these kids, this is an opportunity for them to get a set of hat and gloves that they might not otherwise have. The schools that we serve are usually the high-poverty schools, and so for these kids its a special opportunity for them. Its a great feeling.

      "JOPLIN, Mo.  Christmas has come early for more than 1,800 southwest Missouri school children. As part of its annual Season of Giving campaign, James River Church is spreading holiday cheer gifts to kids in Springfield and Joplin. The church has done this, now, for almost 25 years. Students at West Central Elementary enjoyed the attention and gift bags, this morning along with a visit from Santa. Schools are selected based on several factors including the number of children enrolled in the free or reduced school lunch program. Our kids get to experience something, you know, they might not get to experience. I know James River does their Christmas Play every year, but not all our guests get to attend that, so this is kind of a mini version of that. They get to have a gift to take home and its just real fun experience for them, said Bret Ingle, Principal, West Central Elementary School. We just want them to know that God loves them and we want to share that. That is the most important thing we want them to know through this entire event, is that God sees them and he loves them very much, said Ashley Wilhite, Childrens Pastor, James River Church. The church also did this for the kids at Columbia Elementary this afternoon. Those two schools, of course, will merge into the new Dover Hill Elementary in less than a month. \n",

Today marked the 35th Annual Newton County Food Basket Brigade near the Newton County Fairgrounds. Two weeks worth of food was purchased thanks to a food collection drive held last week, including several monetary donations. The food was handed out to 825 families, some waiting in line for several hours. The Newton County Food Basket Brigades grocery distribution takes place each year during the third week in December, a time when families need staple food items the most. All 825 families went home with two large bags of much-needed grocery items. We try to provide them with two weeks of food during the December period when youve got taxes and Christmas and everything going on, it just helps them divert the money they would be using for food and to do something else with it, said Gary Moon, President, Newton County Food Basket Brigade. Food didnt just go to those who showed up to the distribution facility today. The Food Basket Brigade delivered bags of groceries to nearly 300 home-bound families in Newton County. \n",

At 2,270 sq. ft. , this historic property is one of the truly unique and marvelous residential landmarks in the state. The castle, which is now available for overnight stays on Airbnb for approximately $350/night, borders a city-owned, 640-acre tract of wilderness on top of Shepherd Mountain. It was put up for auction in 2012 after being home to the the Misselhorn family since 1999. They did significant work on the property including aesthetic improvements, a new hot water heater and furnace, and a new rubber roof (just to name a few). Inside this 3 bedroom, 1-1/2 bathroom stone structure, youll find everything to be newly renovated with a style that uniquely matches the castle facade. The first floor features the kitchen and a formal dining room. The second story contains three bedrooms, a full bathroom with granite-tiled shower and bathtub, and a sun room thats enclosed in both stone and cedar walls with a pitched cedar ceiling. The third story consists solely of the tower room, and provides four arched windows for a view of the entire property. The castle was originally built in 1846 by Dr. T. R. Goulding from England. Dr. Goulding apparently missed the English style of architecture, so he created his own castle in the Ozarks, constructed of locally quarried limestone and granite, complete with a three-story tower and winding staircase.

One c-section operating room has been in use since the hospital opened in 2015, but the facility has seen an increase in births over the last several years.

      "JOPLIN, Mo. – Local Amazon warehouse staff members have partnered with Jefferson Elementary to help provide a merry Christmas for the school’s families in need this holiday season. For more than 10 years, Jefferson has hosted an annual Penny Wars event to support Christmas needs. Classes were challenged to drop pennies and dollar bills into buckets to earn positive points toward their class total; silver coins (nickels, dimes, quarters, etc. ) were placed in rival class buckets to subtract points. After four weeks of collection, the class with the highest positive score won a pizza party. This year, Amazon partners heard about the Penny Wars, said Jefferson Principal Dr. Jason Weaver, and offered to donate $2,000 toward the final total. “For the past couple of years, for perspective, we have raised between $1,500 and $1,700 each year,” said Dr. Weaver. “So we knew Amazon’s donation would more than double what we were able to do for Jefferson families in need. ”Staff at Amazon’s Joplin warehouse learned about the opportunity thanks to a relationship fostered on Jefferson’s Site Council. “Most of our campuses host Site Council meetings in order to form relationships with community members interested in joining hands to support that school’s needs,” said Joplin SchoolsDirector of Communications Sarah Coyne. “Site Councils are a fantastic way for our neighbors to have a presence in the schools, and to show the kids and staff that they’re supported by a loving, enthusiastic community. ”In the end, this year’s Penny Wars at Jefferson raised just under $3,000 even before Amazon’sgenerous donation. Families enrolled in the program visited a store with a Jefferson staff member, shopped within a budget, and took gifts home to wrap for their students. Families being specifically helped through Amazon’s donation shopped using a budgeted Amazon Wishlist; pre-wrapped gifts were sent to these families ready to be put under the tree for Christmas. Jefferson teacher Monica Bay helps organize the annual Penny Wars and subsequent Christmas help. “This event brings out such great competition among our staff and students because of the impact it has on our Jefferson families,” said Bay. “Every cent dropped in our buckets brings joy to a kiddo in our building. With Amazon joining us on this journey, we will be able to reach a record number of families this holiday season, and that’s an amazing gift to our building!”\n",

They have a sense of normalcy during a time of medical crisis. Caring sta­ff and volunteers meet their immediate needs. ”Feature Family: The MarrettsOn March 4, 2020, Amber checked in to the hospital and was ordered to remain at the facility on bed rest due to severe preeclampsia.

Postpartum anxiety, separation, insomnia, missing home, and the very unnatural process of letting go and allowing others to care for your baby were all challenges we faced.

      "JOPLIN, Mo. – Joplin Schools has planned several events to celebrate the grand opening of Dover Hill Elementary School. A community Open House will be held from 5:00 to 7:00 p. m. Tuesday, Jan. 3, at the school, 1100 N. Main. Neighbors and community members will be welcomed to tour the school, which opens for classes on Wednesday, Jan. 4. Joplin Schools staff, and Dover Hill parents and students will be invited to tour the building during additional separate events. An invitation-only ribbon cutting ceremony will be held at 10:00 a. m. Thursday, Jan. 12. “We are so excited to be opening Dover Hill Elementary for the students, staff, parents and community,” said Joplin Schools superintendent Dr. Kerry Sachetta. “The new building will address the needs of our students and staff extremely well with the demands of education today. Dover Hill Elementary is another fine example of our community recognizing a need and coming together to support our students’ best interest. ”Construction of the new campus was approved by 79% of Joplin voters during a 2019 bond campaign. Groundbreaking began on April 14, 2021. The Board of Education’s total approved project cost was $27,079,351. 67. Current projections show final construction costs coming in well under budget. Dover Hill will house 450 students with space for three sections of every grade level. It also offers a Communication/Behavior/Social Skills suite for special education students in need of targeted on-site services. The building was designed by CGA Architects and the DLR Group, with assistance from Allgeier Martin & Associates. Crossland Construction managed the project. Principal Architect at CGA Architects, Chad Greer, said he believes architecture should speak to time and place, and Dover Hill is no exception. “As a Joplin Schools alumni and member of the community,” said Greer, “we are proud of DoverHill in the way it captures a historic context with modern touches and how it sits on a prominent and unique location within our community. We are excited for the generations of kids that will experience this new school. ”“In the world of architecture, it seems a rare benefit to have local, vested talent lead a project of this scale,” said CGA Architects Project Designer Christina Williams. Dover Hill will house students from two of Joplin Schools’ previous campuses: West Central Elementary and Columbia Elementary. Both West Central and Columbia elementary schools were originally built in the late 1920s during a period of updates across the Joplin School District to support the city’s growing educational needs. The schools each housed kindergarten through fifth grade students who would eventually attend North Middle School. The new location strategically joins these two zones to bring together a population of students who will continue their academic pursuits together while maintaining a neighborhood community. “We are excited to enter our last phase of integration with the two schools,” said Dover Hill principal Bret Ingle. “Last year we were able to start the collaboration process with staff, and this fall we have been able to bring the students together at two different campuses. Everyone islooking forward to finally being under one roof. ”During the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony, local and regional leaders will be invited to celebrate this new addition to Joplin Schools alongside students and staff. \n",

      "Missouri Southern State failed to monitor its football program, which committed multiple NCAA violations over two academic years, including impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, academic misconduct and violations of countable athletically related activities, according to an agreement released by the Division II Committee on Infractions. A former football assistant coach also violated ethical conduct rules and did not cooperate with an NCAA investigation. The former football head coach violated head coach responsibility rules and ethical conduct rules when he failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance with NCAA rules and was directly involved in violations, according to a decision released by the committee. He failed to monitor his staff’s involvement in student-athletes’ academics after threatening staff jobs if student-athletes failed to perform academically, and he engaged in unethical conduct when he did not meet his obligation to cooperate with an investigation and denied involvement in the violations. This case used different resolution paths. The school and the former academic advisor agreed to the violations and penalties and resolved their case through a negotiated resolution. The former assistant coach did not participate in the investigation, and his violations and penalties were uncontested. The former head coach contested the violations but ultimately stopped participating in the infractions process. The committee considered his violations on the written record. The university, former academic advisor and enforcement staff agreed that the advisor provided impermissible recruiting inducements and impermissible benefits on multiple occasions. The advisor had existing relationships with two student-athletes from her previous job. The first student-athlete lived cost-free at the advisor’s home for several months prior to his enrollment at Missouri Southern State, amounting to approximately $2,000 in impermissible inducements. The advisor also paid an outstanding tuition bill of approximately $1,500 from his previous school, which allowed him to enroll at Missouri Southern State. The advisor later paid a $500 bail fee for another student-athlete who had been arrested while enrolled at the school. Even though both student-athletes ultimately repaid the advisor, the benefits violated NCAA rules. The committee also determined that an additional violation involving recruiting inducements occurred when, after being hired by Missouri Southern State, the former football head coach began recruiting a community college student-athlete who had played for the coach at his previous school. That prospect had an outstanding tuition bill at his prior school, and as a result the college would not release his transcripts so he could transfer. The head coach arranged for a booster to pay that tuition bill, which amounted to more than $8,000. The payment constitutes an impermissible recruiting inducement, and the head coach’s direct involvement violated ethical conduct rules. The prospect later enrolled and competed in eight contests, receiving actual and necessary expenses associated with those competitions, while ineligible. The school and the enforcement staff agreed that during two consecutive summers, the football coaching staff required student-athletes to participate in “captain’s practices,” which involved athlete-led drills and seven-on-seven activities. Those practices were scheduled to accommodate training, summer classes and job schedules for student-athletes, and were directed and observed by members of the coaching staff, resulting in the program exceeding the allowed countable athletics-related activity. The head coach later admitted he was aware of the practices. Additionally, the school and the enforcement staff agreed that the former assistant coach pressured an enrolled student-athlete to complete coursework for a prospect. The assistant coach threatened to withhold the student-athlete’s scholarship if he did not complete the online courses and strictly advised him not to speak to anyone about that arrangement. The committee concluded that the head coach failed to monitor his staff’s involvement in student-athletes’ academics after he threated their jobs if student-athletes failed to perform, noting that “as a result of these threats, an assistant coach engaged in academic misconduct. ”The committee also determined that the head coach did not promote an atmosphere for compliance. In its decision, the committee stated, “[H]e personally created an environment where the athletics leadership and compliance were considered the enemy and used fear and intimidation with his staff members to further that divide. His approach was the antithesis of a compliant program[. ]”The school and enforcement staff agreed that Missouri Southern State failed to monitor its football program. While the school was aware of the tensions between the football program and the athletics department, the school did not enforce the reporting structure with the football head coach or his staff. Finally, the head coach engaged in unethical conduct when he did not meet his obligation to cooperate with an investigation. In addition to providing demonstrably false or misleading information to investigators, the head coach did not agree to violations and penalties in the negotiated resolution with the school and academic advisor but did not respond to the staff’s subsequent notice of allegations or multiple requests for a response from the Committee on Infractions. The university and the enforcement staff used ranges identified by the Division II membership-approved infractions penalty guidelines to agree upon the following penalties:Three years of probation, through Nov. 2, 2025. A $5,000 fine. A reduction in football scholarships to 34. 2 for the 2022-23 academic year. A vacation of all football records in which student-athletes competed while ineligible. The university must provide a written report containing the contests impacted to the NCAA media coordination and statistics staff within 14 days of the public release of the decision. A one-week prohibition against off-campus recruiting contacts and evaluations during the 2022-23 academic year. A one-year show-cause order for the former academic advisor. A four-year show-cause order for the former assistant coach. A two-year disassociation of the booster, as detailed in the public negotiated resolution. After reviewing the head coach’s case, the committee also prescribed the following penalty:A seven-year show-cause order for the former head coach. Members of the Committee on Infractions are drawn from NCAA member schools and conferences and members of the public. The committee members who reviewed this case are Jessica Chapin, director of athletics at American International; David Hansburg, director of athletics at Colorado School of Mines; John David Lackey, attorney; Richard Loosbrock, faculty athletics representative at Adams State; Melissa Reilly, associate commissioner at the East Coast Conference; Leslie Schuemann, senior woman administrator/deputy commissioner at the Great Midwest Athletic Conference; and Jason Sobolik, assistant athletics director for compliance and student services at Minnesota State University Moorhead. \n",

This winter, they have the expected eggnog and peppermint mocha. But theyve thrown in a wild card with their fruit cake flavor, a mix of cherry, almond and orange. Interesting!

Visit 417mag. com/pizza to read our cover story all about the best pizza in 417-land. CLICK HERE Its a tough job, and were just the team to do it. We taste tested toasted ravioli to find the most scrumptious version in town. Since this St. Louis-style staple appears on many menus, we created the following qualifying criteria for candidates. Contenders had to: Be headquartered in 417-land. Primarily serve Italian food. Offer a meat-filled version of toasted ravioli. Open for lunch on Tuesdays (when we conducted our taste test). Answer the phone when we called to order. Four local competitors qualified. Six tasters, including Editorial Designer Grace Chipley, Engagement and Style Editor Colin Shea Denniston, Research Editor Jo Jolliff, Creative Director Sarah Patton, Staff Photographer Leah Stiefermann and Digital Editor Jamie Thomas, assessed the raviolis flavor, texture and sauce. Weve rarely met a toasted rav we wouldnt take home to Mama, so rather than using a best-to-worst paradigm, we judged the contenders on a scale of delight. Twilight Roman Stroll was arbitrarily chosen as the lowest point on the delightfulness index, and Venices Grand Canal signified the apex of delight. Which ravioli scored at Grand Canal levels? It was a tie! Our tasters split evenly in two camps. The ones who craved classic comfort chose the toasted ravioli from Otts Pasta. They praised its texture, filling, snackability and good crunch-to-squish ratio. The second camp consisted of full-on flavor-stans, and they liked Bambinos version for the depth of its traditional Italian herb taste. Bambinos and Otts Pasta share the winning crown. We asked Bob Lowe, a sommelier and owner of The Reserve atTown & County, to suggest ways we might enjoy the fruits of Italian vines. This chianti classico comes from a site with almost 1,000 years of wine production history. Sip it for cherry, spice and tobacco flavors. This 2020 sangiovese vintage was bottled to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its estate. Its grapes came from the oldest vines on the property. This red, which is 80% sangiovese and 20% cabernet, comes from a family-owned winery that dates back to 804 A. D. Made from Sicilian nerello mascalese grapes, this light-in-color-but-big-on-flavor red is grown on Mt. Etna, an active volcano. This fragrant, savory 2021 wine was grown in northern Sardinia and has notes of peach, lemon and salt. Nicola Gilardi tells us, In Italy, we had so many wars, so many civilizations that came in. All that historyand the resilience that sprang from itgot baked in. We learned a lot, he says. In the end, we started to cook with what we grow, using techniques we learned from other countries. Gilardi grew up in Chiavenna, Italy, near the Swiss border. He was the youngest of nine children, so he learned how to eat fast. But here in Springfield, his restaurants tempt you to linger. At Nicolas Italian Ristorante, he serves classics like pork shank and rigatoni beneath moody lighting. At Maso Pizza Bar, youll find pub fare in an everybody knows your name atmos-phere. If you visit either location, theres a good chance youll see Gilardi. Hell greet you warmly, maybe with the traditional Italian double-cheek kiss. He keeps his menus focused and curated so that he can deliver the freshest food. With options like seafood pasta and housemade ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach or beets and goat cheese, most people have no trouble finding something they like. But, he says, I have people call me once in a while and ask me for stuff I dont serve. When people call him up with special requests, hell do his best to accommodate them if he can. Its part of running a local place, he says, and its consistent with how he views his restaurants' place in the community. When you open a restaurant, you do not own the restaurant, Gilardi says. Your customer owns the restaurant. Without them, there would be no business. So each individual who comes to my door owns the restaurant for the time they are here. I've had a passion for Italian food ever since high school, says Daniel Oawster. I always wanted to have an Italian-style restau-rant. A Branson native, Oawster attended Le Cordon Bleu Culinary School in Austin, Texas. Thats where he first started making his own fresh pasta. He returned to 417-land and further strengthened his chef skills by working in restaurants around our region. Then, he says, a windfall struck. Jerry and Judy DeMaro were looking to sell their Ozark restaurant, Salvatores Fresh Ristorante Italianojust at the time Oawster was thinking about opening his own place. We felt like it was a perfect match, Oawster says. He collaborated with the DeMaros on a careful transition, one that would ensure customers at Salvatores continued to enjoy the quality food theyd grown to love, and in 2021, Oawster officially took the helm. Oawster says hes preserved the restaurants core dishes and welcoming, family atmosphere, but I have made the place my home. I live there 60100 hours a week, so I changed a few things. For example, he streamlined the menu and added more gluten-free options, such as zucchini noodles and chickpea pasta. He al-so introduced Salvatores build-your-own pasta, which lets diners choose from nine pasta varieties, plus several sauces, meats and vegetables. With the exception of the chickpea pastawhich is pre-ordered to avoid gluten contamination in the kitchenall of those pasta varieties are made on site at Salvatores. We produce about 200 pounds of pasta a day, Oawster says. Hes thankful for the families whove made Salvatores part of their regular routine and says he wants them to know that we try hard every day to provide the freshest food possible with the freshest ingredients available to us. This means that on any given day, the restaurant might run out of dishes, but he says, Everything we make is fresh. We dont pull anything out of the freezer to serve to anybody. In 2016, Steve DArpino had been thinking about opening his own restaurant for years. Hed worked in restaurant management, and his parents were known for Springfield fave DArpinos Italian Caf. I always had the dream of taking a spin-off of [DArpinos] and doing my own thing, he says. He found the perfect spot in Nixa, and three months later, he and his wife, Cassie, opened Piccolo. Imagine a cross between your favorite Italian date night place and a contemporary gastropub, and youve got the right vibe. DArpinos marinara sauce is a staple on the menu at Piccolo, alongside inventive dishes featuring seafood and steaks. There are plenty of vegan options, too. Piccolo partners with 417-land producer Jakes Burgers to offer plant-based versions of dishes like pizza, lasagna and spaghetti Bolognese. I take pride in being able to accommodate that, DArpino says. Inclusive menu options are just one way DArpino replicates the neighborhood feel of the Springfield caf his parents operated for 14 years before their retirement at the end of 2017. Piccolo builds on the welcoming energy his parents cultivatedwith bigger din-ing space and an expansive bar. Its a great accomplishment, especially considering that DArpino says, When I was a kid, my parents didnt think I was theirs be-cause I didnt like marinara sauce. With two Sicilian grandfathers and a foodie family, he was surrounded by authentic Italian cook-ing, but he says: All I would eat was butter noodles. I was 10 when I decided I liked pasta sauce. Now, he not only likes it, he makes it. For Piccolos customers, thats certainly something to celebrate. One morning in 2019, Martha Cooper woke up, with this incredibly strong compulsion to change the business. The business in question was Sisters in Thyme, the deli shed been running with Gina Cooper for more than a decade. She says it wasnt bringing her joy anymore, and she felt compelled to shift her focus to Italian food, which had always been her passion. In just six weeks, Martha and Gina made the transformation; Basilico Italian Caf opened in the old Sisters in Thyme location on Commercial Street. I try very hard to act on my intuition, Martha says. Now, she gets to indulge her love for Italian food in a setting that makes you feel like youre at a cozy corner spot in Brooklyn. At Basilico, comfort is the goal. When customers walk in, theyre urged to take any seat where theyll feel comfortable. I want them to enjoy their meal, sit and visit, have a glass of wine, Martha says. Alongside intimate, date-night friendly tables, theres a special place designed for big family gatherings. It seats 12, and Martha says shes always happy to make room for more. Our family table fills up and is so joyful, she says. Diners enjoy tender pasta with Marthas delicately flavored sauces. With the exception of the marinara, which she makes ahead, every sauce is prepared to order for maximum freshness. And to make sure everyone truly feels welcome, Basilico offers extensive gluten-free options, even on the dessert menu. Martha and Gina work with two pastry chefsone traditional and one who bakes without glutento ensure theres no cross-contamination. I base everything on simplicity, Martha says. I want people to enjoy food thats been created simply where you can taste all the ingredients. Southwest Missouri's shops and restaurants can bring Italian-style abundance to your Yuletide.

Nicola Gilardi tells us that back in Italy, his family always enjoyed panettone on Christmas Eve. They served it with spumante, Italian sparkling wine, and they typically ate it after midnight mass. This sounds like a fine plan. If youve never had this sweet, leavened bread, imagine a blissful brioche studded with candied fruit. Pickwick & Cherry makes a few extra panettone for customers who walk in to purchase them, but if you want to guarantee you get one, order ahead at pickwickandcherry. com.

      "You can fuel up for the day with unique takes on classic breakfast fare at Danis Flour Pot Bakery, the sweet little eatery with an upcoming name change to Sleepy Opossum Cafe. Jan 2023 Best Places to See Christmas Lights New Year's Eve Events in the Ozarks Best of 417 2022 Winners The Plate: Dishes to Try Right Now 25 Ways to Fall in Love with Southwest Missouri What makes a hole-in-the-wall restaurant feel like such a treat? Maybe its the quaint charm, or the super-chill atmosphere, or the fact that it feels a little bit like a well-kept secret. Danis Flour Pot Bakery has all those elementsand great breakfast fare to boot. The sweet little shop, which will soon change its name to Sleepy Opossum Cafe, is located inside The Royal at Rountrees hopping Pickwick and Cherry intersection. In the morning, Danis Flour Pot Bakery uses the space to serve breakfast and lunch, and in the evening The Royal slings cocktails and snacks. On a recent and frigid winter morning, I popped in to give owner Dani Hunnells breakfast fare a try, and it felt like such a relief from the chill to walk into the warm, sunny and charmingly decorated space that delivers strong Wes Anderson vibes. The menu is a mix of breakfast fare that looks pretty traditional at first glance but actually holds some creative surprises. Instead of pie crust, the quiche is surrounded by a layer of hash browns. The breakfast tacos feature a spicy-sweet sriracha syrup. Even the hot cocoa is outside the expected; its a Mexican hot chocolate. I knew I had to try one of the quiches. They are filled with seasonal ingredients, often from local farms, so the options change. On my visit, they were offering one that was made with caramelized pumpkin and gorgonzola cheese. I found a cozy table with sofa seating and a view out the window. When the quiche arrived (along with an excellent mug of coffee from the popular Bentonville coffee shop Onyx), I was immediately charmed. Everything was served on mismatched plates and cups, all with a sweet vintage vibe. Not only did the quiche have a hashbrown crust, but it was packed with hashbrowns on the inside as well. The slice arrived piping hot and really big. It was so deliciousthe definition of comfort food with all that potato and cheese and egg. But it was just as surprising as it was comforting. The pumpkin wasnt too sweet; instead it complemented the more savory flavors beautifully. Every nibble that had a bit of gorgonzola in it was my favoritejust such a tasty combo of ingredients. It was too big to finish on my own, so I had to stop myself from filling up so I could save a little room for the brled grapefruit. Its a delightful breakfast side. A fresh grapefruit half is topped with sugar thats then brled into a caramelized, crisp, crackable treat on top. I love a grapefruit, even at its most bitter, but adding that caramelized sugar is just the icing on the cake. I also ordered a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich to bring home to my husband, and of course I stole a couple bites. (For science!) The homemade biscuits are sprinkled with everything bagel seasoning and filled with thick-cut bacon and a scrambled egg. Theres a little dollop of jam inside too. I loved every element except the jam; it was too sweet for me. But if youre in the jam-plus-breakfast-meats camp, youll love it. Although I have never tried them, Ive spent a lot of time admiring the beautiful cakes from Danis Flour Pot Bakery. They are served in seasonal flavors and are topped with colorful accents like fluffy buttercream, colorful flowers and bright compotes. You can order these online, and at press time they were offering one of my all-time favorite dessert flavors: Earl grey. We did get to try one of the other sweet treats, though. I ordered a cinnamon roll to go and brought it home to share with my kids. Cinnamon rolls are always a hit with my family (I mean, who doesnt love a cinnamon roll?), and this one didnt disappoint. The outside was beautifully golden with sticky-sweet icing, but it was that very middle layer that we tussled over. So soft, sweet and perfectly spiced! It was the ideal complement to the extra cup of coffee that I took to-go. New restaurants, menus and chef change-ups brought a lot of excitement to Springfield's dining scene this year.

      "This year, 417 Magazine celebrates our 25th anniversary. Thats 25 years of writing about the best stuff in Springfield, Missouri and sharing it with you. Here are 25 ways to fall head over heels for this place we call home. Jan 2023 This year, 417 Magazine celebrates our 25th anniversary. Thats 25 years of writing about the best stuff in and around Springfield, Missouri and sharing it with you. We knew the only way to honor this big birthday is to honor the whole entire reason we exist in the first place: We seriously love 417-land. And you probably do too. But just in case you need a reminder of why this region is so wonderful, we put together a list of 25 ways to fall head over heels for this place we call home.  Theres just something about this lake. Its hard to describe it in words because, honestly, its mostly a feeling. Table Rock Lake feels like friends and family, like a lazy day in the Ozarks, like the best kind of summer fun. Its popular enough to provide loads of marinas and places to rent boats and fun toys like wakeboards. But its quiet enough that you can enjoy those water sports or relax with a cove swim without sweating the boat traffic. The scenery at Table Rock Lake is unbeatable, and those sparkling waters and surrounding Ozarks hills are gorgeous when viewed from the deck of a boat. The sprawling green-and-blue vistas still take our breath away after all these years. We love bringing out-of-town visitors to Table Rock Lake for the day because, without a doubt, its the quickest way for them to fall in love with this place too. We can't get enough of our local lakes, springs and waterways. Whether you're looking for swimming holes, springs, waterfalls or outdoor adventures on the water, we've probably written about it.  Top of the Rock is like an Ozarks beauty gateway drug. You might not think youre all that into the Ozarks mountains or the outdoors, but then you find yourself at Top of the Rock and are immediately wowed. Its like all of the regions natural quirks, all in one place: Theres a cave (with a bar inside, might we add), a sinkhole (hello, karst topography), a scenic golf course and the Ancient Ozarks Natural History Museum featuring Native American artifacts from the region. But the icing on the cake is the sunset view. Grab a seat on the Buffalo Bar patio or near the tall windows at Osage Restaurant, and watch the sun go down over Table Rock Lake. Its a heart-swelling scene of natural beauty that we cant get enough of. Speaking of picturesque patios, we have a whole guide dedicated to the best spots to sit outdoors and relax on a patio.  We dont want to say this too loudly because its better for us all if the rest of the Midwest isnt in on the secret: But we have the best rivers here in the Ozarks. Spring-fed streams wind around the hills and valleys past thick forest, rocky bluffs and plenty of beautiful flora and fauna. As you kayak along, youre almost certain to spot a blue heron stopping to catch a fish or some turtles sunning themselves on a log. And hopping off your kayak or canoe to plunge into the cold, crystal-clear water is like a baptism on a hot summer day. Youll feel brand new. One of our favorites is the North Fork of the White River, with its quiet little rapids and its abundance of naturally breeding rainbow trout. For a setting that feels wild and remote, we recommend the Eleven Point River. And for something super-easy to access from Springfield, the James River is always a sure bet. But those are just three of our favorite options. There are truly so many streams to explore. For more of our favorite float trips, take a look at our full guide to floating in the Ozarks.  When people explain why they love living in Springfield, they often say its because of the small-town feel with big-city amenities. And we think Millsap Farms Pizza Night fits the bill. Its just a short few minutes north of the city bustle of Springfield, but it feels like youre in a quieter place from another time. A sweet little clearing in the trees features string lights and a stage for live music, and guests can relax with a plate of freshly made wood-fired pizza as the night gets dark and the fireflies start to come out. It feels like community and country, all at once. Our recommendation: Bring a bottle of wine and your favorite friends, and let yourself slow down a little while youre there. If you bring the kids, theres even an area where they can run and play while you sip your malbec and listen to some tunes in the fresh air. Does it get any better than that? Millsap Farms isn't the only place that offers great pizza. Take a look at our guide to the best pizza in southwest Missouri.  It feels so good to experience Springfield with the community all around, which is why we love all of the annual events that are essentially great big parties in the street. Every year on the first weekend in May, ArtsFest brings together booth after booth of juried artists work along Historic Walnut Street, along with live performances from local talent and some tasty street food. In September, a similar juried art exhibition takes place in the same spot, but Cider Days has a distinct fall vibe, tons of pumpkins and opportunities to indulge in the events namesake drink. Summertime brings Taste of SOMO to Springfields Park Central Square, featuring food samples from local restaurants, a biergarten and live music. The annual Birthplace of Route 66 Festival in August is an outdoor blast from the past, with tons of classic cars on display and an overall vibe that pays homage to the Mother Roads connection to Springfield.  A Springfield mainstay thats getting better every year, Springfield Art Museum is a true treasure. Open since 1928 with a focus on art appreciation, education and preservation, the museum features a permanent collection of more than 10,000 works of fine art, plus temporary and traveling exhibitions. And its a true fixture in the community, offering kids summer camps, adult education, chic events like the annual 99X fundraiser and more. Right now, the museum is in the middle of a long improvements campaign that has already resulted in the naturalization of Fassnight Creek and will continue with extensive building renovations and expansions in the next few years.  If youre a parent, you probably already know that the abundance of kid-friendly attractions in Springfield makes this an awesome place to live for anybody with kiddos. We love to combine a few kid-friendly favorites into one big day ofun. Start the day off at Dickerson Park Zoo, where you can feed a giraffe, pet a few goats and see wildlife from all across the globe, all hanging out right here in Springfield. Then, take the kid party downtown to visit Discovery Center of Springfield, where they can get their science on by interacting with hands-on educational exhibits about everything from dinosaur bones to the hair-raising experience of touching a Tesla coil. Then, head to another nearby animal-centric spot: National Tiger Sanctuary. There you can take a tour where kids will learn about a variety of great big cats and what their lives are like at the sanctuary.  How awesome is it to watch art come to life, up on stage and right in front of you? Snagging a ticket to one of the many performing arts shows in Springfield will awaken a new appreciation of our citys cultural gusto. You can see a Broadway Series show (like this seasons Hamilton run) at Juanita K. Hammons Hall for the Performing Arts, see talented actors in live plays from both Springfield Little Theatre and Springfield Contemporary Theatre, listen to beautiful music from Springfield Symphony Orchestra, marvel at the leaping dancers from Springfield Ballet, see Missouri State theatre students perform at the John Goodman Amphitheatre, hear incredible voices through Ozarks Lyric Opera, watch national touring comedians at the Blue Room Comedy Club and so much more.  If youve made southwest Missouri your home but didnt grow up here: You know youve become a true 417-lander when Springfield-style cashew chicken evolves from What the heck? to a go-to comfort food in your mind. We opt for the original for this dish: Leongs Asian Diner, run by Wing Yee Leong, who is the son of Springfield-style cashew chicken inventor, David Leong. But thats not the only unique-to-here flavor that 417-landers love. Theres the massive and saucy Sancho Enchilada Style and the sweet chip dipping sauce from Mexican Villa. Theres the summery sweetness of a bowl of Pineapple Whip (especially the grape-pineapple swirl). Theres the perennial joy of dipping your spoon into an Ozarks Turtle from Andys Frozen Custard and fishing out the perfect pecan-loaded bite. And theres the warm and sloppy-in-the-best-way comfort of a bowl of chili from Caspers. Don't know where to search for great local eats? 417 Magazine's annualBest of 417list can help.  Attending any sporting event is an exercise in community spirit. When you hear the crack of the bat right before a crowd of thousands all leaps up to cheer at the same moment, it really doesnt get much better than that. We especially love experiencing that sporting feeling at a Springfield Cardinals game. Hammons Field is big enough to make you feel like youre part of something significant when you go there for a game, but small enough that you can explore without feeling overwhelmed. A great family-friendly activity, Springfield Cardinals games feature fun on-field games, fun promotions, Kids Corner activities, visits from Louie, interesting eats (and people get pretty serious about those $1 brat nights) and some seriously good post-game fireworks during weekend games in the summer.  Were lucky in here in Springfield: We have a pretty long growing season, and a whole lot of gorgeous plants thrive here. And one spot in Springfield is the aspiring gardener or flower admirers dream: Nathanael Greene/Close Memorial Park. Start at the Mizumoto Japanese Stroll Garden, where winding foot paths, water features, manicured gardens and darling structures combine for a truly serene experience. Then, make your way along the sidewalk that takes you all the way around the rest of the 113-acre park. Youll walk past dozens of themed gardens, like a little grove of redbud trees that is absolutely on fire in the spring, the Roston Butterfly House, the ornamental grasses garden (which feels a little otherworldly in the best way if you venture deep inside), the pretty little dwarf conifer garden with its curved wood footbridge, and (our favorite) the shady and expansive hosta garden located right beside Lake Drummond. If flowers are your thing, there are gardens filled with roses, irises, peonies and more. And those are just a few of the pretty little spots where you can take in the sights and smells of these lovely gardens.  Weve said it before, and well say it again: Theres no place like 417-land. Hiking, mountain biking and walking trails weave through the regions varying vistas. There are gently rolling hills, deciduous forests and rocky dolomite glades. Alongside our sparkling rivers, rushing springs and sprawling lakes you can spot limestone bluffs and other interesting rocky features. Thanks to karst topography, Missouri is speckled with more than 7,300 caves both big and small, and here in 417-land you can visit several of them for tours that let you get an up-close look at how these natural wonders were formed over millions of years. So whether youre casually strolling one of the Ozark Greenway trails, touring Fantastic Caverns or exploring trails through the more remote reaches of the Ozarks, youll never run out of reasons to keep your eyes wide open so you dont miss a single beautiful scene.  The brewery scene in Springfield has exploded in recent yearsand its still growing, with at least two big brewery expansions already underway. We love this trend. Whats better than gathering a few favorite friends to relax outside at one of these spots with a locally brewed beer and some live music. Each brewery shares an easygoing community vibe, but each location has its own personality too. At Tie & Timber, its all about the spacious tiered patio thats a little oasis in the city. At Wire Road Brewing, its the sloping tree-filled gathering space with tons of room to spread out. At Mothers Brewing Company, its the wide grassy lawn where community events take place throughout the year. At Piney River, its the big red barn where you can have a beer or a fresh pizza. The list goes on and on, but one things for sure across the board: These are exceptional places to gather for that 417 feeling.  Like so many 417-landers, the Branson Ferris Wheel wasnt born here. It is a native Chicagoan, spending 20 years at the citys Navy Pier and lifting tourists high above Lake Michigan for that perfect view. Now, this historic Ferris wheel is a Bransonite through-and-through. Its new home is on the Highway 76 strip at The Track Family Fun Parks Track 4. Instead of lifting those 40 gondolas over Lake Michigan, it now lifts them over Branson, offering views of the citys funky attractions and the surrounding wooded Ozarks hillsides. Its the perfect way to get the lay of the land.  Spotting fine art out in the wild is a pretty awesome experience. And in recent years, its been easier than ever to do that here. From the influx of building-side murals scattered around Springfield to ongoing events like Springfield Sculpture Walk and the annual Overlay Festival, its practically an art explosion around here! The murals, like the Do Good mural on Commercial Street or the Springfield mural on the side of the Discovery Center building, provide little photo ops and colorful bursts of local pride. The sculptures, some of which are permanent and some of which change each year, give you the perfect excuse to head out on a walk through the city to admire the sometimes super-funky freestanding artwork that adds interest to busy street corners. And Overlay Festival (which you might have attended last fall when it was called MidXMdwst) brings art to life with large-scale installations and live mural painting along with musical performances and other events. So what does all of this mean to the average 417-lander? It means that there are people here working to make our region more beautiful, colorful and quirky every day. We love seeing the arts and culture scene in Springfield grow and have covered everything from new gallery spaces to Q&A's with local artists.  At Wonders of Wildlife National Museum & Aquarium, the under-the-sea exhibits and natural wildlife dioramas are expansive and immersive, so there are loads of opportunities to see something spectacular and learn something new. Our absolute favorite: following the path of fish both big and small as they float through the water in the Open Ocean area. The circular tank is like a sea creature highway, with the coolest critters swimming past as you watch. And we arent the only ones who think this magical attraction is something to be proud of. Wonders of Wildlife earned an accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and has won numerous awards, including Americas Best Aquarium and Americas Best New Attraction (both courtesy of USA Today readers).  Silver Dollar City is a blast for both tourists and locals at any time of year, but you cant help falling in love with it during Christmas. The parks An Old Time Christmas festival includes the biggest holiday lights display weve ever seen, with a whopping 6. 5 million lights covering practically every building and even strung across walkways to make sparkly overhead displays. There are festive holiday shows and plenty of seasonal treats to eat too. The Christmas celebration is so popular, it has won USA Todays readers poll for Best Theme Park Holiday Event five times! As if the sensory experience of taking in all those lights werent enough, the rides are open too, of course. So you can spin yourself right back to reality on the wild Time Traveler or blast yourself into roller coaster heaven on PowderKeg while you are there too. Silver Dollar City isn't the only great place to see Christmas lights. Take a look at our roundup of holiday light displays around southwest Missouri.  When Johnny Morris teamed up with Tiger Woods to design the uniquely beautiful Paynes Valley Golf Course, we knew wed hit the big time when it comes to golf.

      "A coalition of local organizations provides shelter for our unhoused neighbors during the coldest months. Jan 2023 With coordination through the Community Partnership of the Ozarks, the Ozarks Alliance to End Homelessness has created a network of crisis cold weather shelters, bringing together local faith-based and not-for-profit organizations to provide shelter to vulnerable members of the Springfield community. According to Adam Bodendieck, Director of Homeless Services for the Community Partnership of the Ozarks, the shelters can see up to 200 individuals on the coldest nights of the year. The CPO and Ozarks Alliance to End Homelessness partnership has helped to streamline certain overarching issues like volunteer recruitment, conducting trainings and coordinating pick-up and transportation. We work with city utilities transit and then our own shuttle to provide transportation to and from the shelters [and] coordinate with various meal site providers to make sure that folks are getting dinner as part of the process, says Bodendieck. Interested in learning more about volunteer opportunities or for ways you can support the unsheltered population in Springfield?

      "For an extra bit of holiday warmth, consider adding chestnuts to your favorite winter recipes. Dec 2022 The seasonal lore of roasting chestnuts is often thought of as a nostalgic Christmastime activity. While these delicious nuts do make for a good treat all on their own, they are also delicious in both sweet and savory recipes. Owners of Gaunts Chestnuts (417-736-3810) Don and Vera Gayle Gaunt like to use chestnuts in everything from dessert truffles to soups because of their ability to enhance the flavors of whatever dish theyre added to. The Gaunts planted their first chestnut trees in 1991 and now have 26 trees in their grove. They sell the chestnuts at the Farmers Market of the Ozarks located in Farmers Park once they start to harvest them in the fall. Theyre really popular in the winter because of the song about chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Of course, down at the farmers market we dont do the open fire because we didnt think the fire department would appreciate that too much, Vera Gayle jokes. With each bag of chestnuts purchased, the Gaunts give buyers a brochure featuring recipes and instructions for cooking and taking care of the nuts. They also hand out their phone number so they can further help to educate others. We love educating people to see how they could be used and its really quite interesting to see what people come up with themselves, she says. Over their many years of growing and selling chestnuts, the Gaunts have worked to educate and teach many others about chestnuts, from customers, to neighbors, to students, to grandchildren, to people whove recently moved to 417-land from other countries. The Gaunts have shared their passion with others in hopes that they would also plant chestnut trees. While their grove is currently one of the oldest chestnut groves in Missouri, they hope to see many other groves come to fruition in 417-land to further share their passion.

Dec 2022 With a background in photography and interior design, Colby Kern recently turned to the world of painting after being told he has a natural eye for composition. His paintings feature monochromatic palettes, texture and organic patterns. In each of Kerns works he builds layers of paint to create a personality of the piece that cant be recreated. This process of creating his paintings is what has become the most important to Kern. He falls in love with every piece he creates and works to make artwork he would hang in his own home.

      "Sarah Williams explains how a spur-of-the-moment vacation rippled out into a whole lot of kindness. Dec 01 2022 at 8 a. m. When I was a child, my parents lived life flying by the seat of their pants. My home was fun and spontaneous but not always well-planned. This was never more true than with vacations. My family went snow skiing literally every year for Christmas. Yet, this somehow caught my parents by surprise each December. The year I was about 10 years old, my siblings and I got home from school for winter break. My mom decided to start thinking about our travel plans, since Christmas was five days away. She called to make reservations, and the only available flight was on Christmas Day. My mom hated the idea of people having to work on a holiday to accommodate people like us. But if we were going to go skiing that year, it was our only option. In addition to the enormous task of getting my big family ready for a vacation plus Christmas, my mom took us shopping for gifts to give the flight crew. If we were going to be those people who flew on Christmas, we could at least bear gifts. A few days later, we were ready to board our flight. As a middle child, I got to do the jobs no one else in my family wanted to do. Which, that day, was giving the gifts to the flight crew. I was a shy kid. Without making eye contact, I passed out the gifts as quickly as I could and took my seat, relieved it was over. The plane took off. When we reached cruising altitude, the flight attendant tapped me on the shoulder and said, Miss, I need you to come with me. I followed her all the way up to first class, where she sat me in an empty seat and pampered me with food and drinks for the entire flight. She even gave me ice cream. While my family was enjoying their six peanuts in coach, I was living a life of luxury! All because my mom cared enough to be kind. The hustle and bustle of the holiday season can be overwhelming. Anyone who works retail can attest to the horrors of people this time of year. Family relationships might be strained. December has a lot happening all at once. Yet it costs zero dollars to be kind. The Christmas season is hard for many people. Being a little extra considerate goes a long way in making someones day brighter. Compliment someone who feels overlooked. Take warm soup to a grieving widow. Send a restaurant gift card to a single mom or a friend who just lost their job. Overtip servers. Be wildly generous with your time, money, talents, listening ear, kind smile and encouraging words. Choosing to be kind is one of the greatest gifts you could ever give. You may never know the difference youll make today. Or how your children might still remember it three decades later. Just ask that 10-year-old girl who has never forgotten the sweetest bowl of ice cream.

      "Think like a florist and create your own beautiful winter arrangement with these pro tips. Dec 2022 Creating your own floral arrangement during the winter months can seem a bit daunting as the landscapes turn brown and our flowers wilt away. However, with a little creativity and a new outlook you can create a seasonal display thats truly beautiful for your home. Think outside of the traditional vase and use a champagne bucket, a vintage coffee pot or an antique soup tureen to begin your arrangement. Then you can begin to build your arrangement. The base for an arrangement is always evergreen for a winter arrangement and if you dont have an evergreen tree, Im sure you have a friend or relative who does and they wouldnt mind you taking a few clips, says Betsy Schaffitzel of Schaffitzels Flowers & Greenhouses (1771 E Atlantic St, Springfield, 417-866-6222). Soak your greenery in an ice bath before use and spritz the needles from time to time to keep them from drying out. I love juniper! Its not just the green foliage, but it also shows adorable little steely blue berries that add the perfect little detail and texture to your winter arrangements, says Haley Day of Sunday Flower Company (417-844-1434). Other great greenery to look for would be magnolia leaves and boxwood. Purchase a few flowers by the stem for pretty blooms. Youll likely find blooms like roses, carnations, anemones and ranunculus are readily available during winter months. You can also start your own bulbs indoors and use them in your arrangements. Ive always loved amaryllis, says Day. It offers such a large, luxurious, elegant bloom that you really dont get with anything else around Christmas. You can choose from white, red or shades of pink. Paperwhites are one of my favorite winter blooms, says Ron Johnson of The Nest (1856 E Cinderella St Suite C, Springfield, 417-889-6707). Take a look around the inside of your home for blooms as well. Another great place to forage are your houseplants. They add beautiful texture and color such as a red anthurium bloom, says Schaffitzel. Head into your backyard or to the park and look for acorns, pine cones and unique looking sticks. Forsythia stems are great to use for their flexibility and add height and texture, say Schaffitzel. Pulling off some bark from your trees or bark from cut firewood are great elements. Keep your eyes peeled for dead perennials such as coneflower, black-eyed Susan, and sedum. Youll find great seed pods on them to cut and add to your arrangement. You can add additional color by using seasonal fruits. Oranges and pomegranate are my go-to fruits to add to arrangements, but you should try a few things and see what works best, says Johnson. You can even add holiday ornaments to your arrangements; just remove them after the holidays for an arrangement that can last into January. A simple ribbon is another fun way to add a pop of color or pattern to an arrangement. Jenn Fortner and her family make painted wrapping paper each year for that extra special, handmade touch on their Christmas presents. Wrap your home in a cozy blanket of warm colors this winter.

      " A dozen church kids will bring a message of hope and celebrate the heritage of a 117-year-old chapel originally built to be a haven for the community. The event will enable church members to reach out to fellow neighbors, said Sims Corner Church Pastor Monty Muehlebach. \"The program this year is unlike anything I've heard before, and it's been very difficult for me not to yell it from the rooftops,\" Muehlebach said. A group of children, ages 2 to 16, will present the unique program on Friday, Dec. 23, at SimsBerry Chapel, 101 State Highway 90. The event will begin with a free prime rib dinner, starting at 6 p. m. , with the play to follow. Reservations are not required for the event, which is open to the public. The pastor, who also owns and operates Cowboy Catering Company, sees serving good food as a way to reach people. He serves the community six times a year through various events. Preparing enough food for free events can be challenging. How do you know if you'll serve 10 or 100? Muehlebach relies on his experience to figure out how to prepare for a possible crowd of 185. Mainly, he relies on a higher power. \"I'm just gonna buy a bunch and see what God does,\" he said. Muehlebach started Sims Corner Church in 2016 and holds services in the building across the road from the chapel. The church hosts an annual Christmas dinner and play to honor the birth of Jesus Christ, he said. \"When we purchased the SimsBerry Chapel built in 1914, we have wanted to carry on that tradition,\" Muehlebach said. \"We discovered the chapel was actually designed for plays and theatrical events. \" The Sims and Berry families built the chapel after starting a church in 1905 in Granny's branch, he said. The chapel can accommodate 100 people and seat 85 downstairs. The chapel is undergoing a restoration and upgrade. Muehlebach plans to rent the spot as a wedding destination starting sometime next year. He sees the rich heritage of the chapel as a deeply rooted mission to reach out to others. \"We always hope to share and build up this community in Christ by letting the community know the church is here to help,\" he said. \"We do so by creating events but also being a place that can help bring answers to real questions and real problems people face as individuals, families, and as a community,\" he said. \"God has a plan for this corner, and He has been working on it for 117 years,\" he said. \"We are very happy and excited to continue His will for this church and this community,\" Muehlebach said. \"Please come and join us in celebration of the birth of our savior as we eat prime rib and hear a message of hope in the cross that will forever change your life,\" he said. \n",

      " SOUTHWEST CITY -- The Ozark Valley Christmas Tree Farm, on 1090 Manning Road, has been selling trees for 11 years. It's a family business. And at the head are husband and wife John and Charity Keith. Last Wednesday, on Dec. 7, Gov. Mike Parson honored the family as it presented its wreath at Jefferson City. Ozark Valley Christmas Tree Farm is a member of the Missouri Christmas Tree Growers Association. Each year, members of the organization vote for the best tree and wreath. This year, it was Charity and John Keith who won the \"2022 Best Wreath. \" Winners have the honor of presenting their trees and wreath to the governor in Jefferson City. \"It's just a beautiful experience because they put it right in at the top of the rotunda,\" said Charity Keith. \"And the wreath is above the Governor's office, hanging on the upper wall above his doorway. So everybody that comes to the Capitol . . . sees it. \" At the ceremony, Gov. Parson spoke a few words about the importance of Christmas tree farmers and agriculture. Also present at the ceremony were the state secretary of agriculture and representatives from \"Missouri Grown USA. \" Charity Keith spoke at the ceremony. \"(I) talked about the Christmas tree industry and how we entered into the industry,\" she said, \"what's life like as a farmer, how many people participate, and things like that. It's really good exposure for farms. \" And the farm itself has been in the family for 150 years. For 17 years, the family has used part of that land for the Christmas tree farm. While people might assume it's a simple operation, there's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes. \"We have to just keep replanting every year,\" said Charity Keith. \"Every year, every spring, we just continuously replant trees to keep the next batch coming up. \" But there is more than just planting trees. Each tree needs attention. \"We have to watch out for invasive bugs or pests. We have to watch out for diseases that will attack Christmas trees. Trees get sick just like people do. \" At the farm, they work together with other local businesses. They have food trucks, photographers, and a toy shop with a toy maker. In their gift shop, they have about 25 different vendors who come in. There, they create, have crafts, make T-shirts, ornaments and candles. Visitors may be intimidated by cutting their own trees. The farm asserts it'll make it easy and take care of its customers. It'll cut the tree, trim it, and bail it for visitors. The Ozark Valley Christmas Tree Farm also creates and sells wreaths at its location. All this effort from Ozark Valley Christmas Tree Farm comes down to this. \"When folks come, they don't just come and go. They come and spend some time with their families and enjoy their experience. And once they're here . . . it's about creating a memory. \" \n",

      " SOUTHWEST CITY -- The city council in Southwest City, at its meeting on Tuesday, approved the purchases of a backhoe fork and a new desktop computer for the public works department and \"ITI Solutions\" software for the police department. The goal of these purchases is to save time and money for the city. Present at this meeting were Mayor David Blake, Alderman Steven Golden Sr. , Alderman Gloria Armstrong, Alderman George Snow, Alderman Ridge Carpenter, Police Chief Bud Gow, and City Clerk Jenifer Anderson. Chief Gow has returned to work after spending time healing from knee surgery. After the roll call, Blake took a moment to commend the public works department for its efforts in setting up the Christmas lights on Main Street. \"These boys\" have \"done exceptionally well,\" Blake said. Gow requested the council approve the purchase of \"ITI solutions\" software from Omnigo for the police department. Omnigo is a software company, and according to the company's website, ITI Solutions is a \"comprehensive software created by law enforcement professionals, for law enforcement professionals. \" This will help to speed the process of writing tickets, according to Gow. The department was writing hard-copy tickets, but this software will make ticket writing easier and more efficient. \"They get the information immediately. That's one less stop for them (the police department) to make. With the ID card printer, you don't have to buy hard-copy tickets anymore. They just hit print, and it prints something. So, 'Here's your ticket and here's your court date,'\" said Gow. Other police departments in McDonald County also use ITI Solutions software. \"We virtually share this information. We car stop somebody, it'll pop up Anderson PD stopped this person on Thursday for speeding . . . So we get that information instantly. \" The price of the software, with the printers for the police units, is $4,500. Gow stood in for public works department supervisor Shane Clark and asked the council for its approval to purchase a Dell computer for $500. The previous computers they had, they \"couldn't get it any to work,\" Gow said. \"He really needs a desktop computer in his office,\" said Gow, \"because of what he has to do for us. He takes classes, and we have to set him up with a webcam, and . . . he does his federal state reports. \" The department asked the council to approve the purchase of a fork for the \"backhoe and the Kubota\" for the amount of $412. 97. These forks will be interchangeable for the machines and help the department move pallets, equipment and materials at around 4,000 to 6,000 pounds. This purchase won't only help with time and money but promote safety for residents. If the city asked for outside help, this would be a liability, especially if someone was injured. Other business After reviewing and careful consideration, the city council approved the 2023 budgets for the water, street and sewer departments. The city has approved Courtney Gilbert's application for a business license for Aunt C's Malt Shop. When Anderson inquired of the council, Blake responded: \"Absolutely. \" The city paid bills in the amount of $26,910. 31. It was reported that, this week, a council member and a police officer would review and judge this year's Southwest City's annual \"Christmas Lights Contest. \" During the contest, they will browse the city, looking for the house with the best decorations and Christmas lights. The winners will be announced on Tuesday, Dec. 20, with monetary prizes for first-, second- and third-place lighting displays. \n",

      " The courtroom at the McDonald County Courthouse was filled with well-wishers on Dec. 9 as a retirement reception was held for Kenny Underwood, who was retiring as the McDonald County recorder of deeds. He said he held the role for 18 years and worked for two years before that as a janitor at the courthouse. Before coming to work at the courthouse, he worked for 30 years with his father at the family-owned grocery store, Don's grocery in Pineville. \"I've about worked myself out of a job,\" he said. \"It was a lot of hard work when I started, but we've modernized and got a lot online. \" He said he does not see people as much as he used to now that the deeds are online, and he misses seeing people. \"Deeds are what keep our country great,\" he said. \"When you get a deed to your property, no one can take that away from you. The United States has one of the best systems of land ownership. It saves a lot of problems. \" He said his office's records go back 50 years in online images, and there are names indexed back to 1918 that can be looked up in person. \"I've really enjoyed working here, but it's time for me to move on,\" he said. \"I've always wanted to sleep in one morning, and this is my opportunity. \" He said his plans for retirement include a lot of cooking, which is one of his longtime passions, and babysitting his granddaughter. \n",

      " PINEVILLE -- The McDonald County Chamber of Commerce, at 308 Harmon Street, is remodeling and developing new improvements to its office. This will include a cafe and more outdoor space so visitors can enjoy their coffee outside. John Newby is the president and CEO of the McDonald County Chamber of Commerce. The task of the organization is to help bring awareness to local businesses and help boost the economy within the county. This includes applying for grants to better the city. \"I think, if we get these grants, even if we get one of them, it'll be a game changer for the chamber,\" said Newby. \"It'll open people's eyes to see what we're doing. \" The chamber has applied to the American Rescue Plan Act and also works closely with the Missouri Department of Economic Development to help find these funds. With these funds, the chamber wants to expand and remodel the chamber building to give it a more contemporary look. This remodeling work will include extending the sidewalk and installing a coffee shop. Visitors who enter now see a giant window that looks out into the street. \"Eventually, this gets torn out, and they're going to bump the sidewalk out four feet and put a railing on it,\" said Newby. Newby says that McDonald County doesn't really have a coffee shop in the area now, and if a resident wants a Starbucks coffee, he or she would have \"to travel 20 minutes to Bentonville. \" The chamber plans to have a \"topnotch\" coffee shop like Starbucks that will have \"coffee, pastries, and smoothies. \" Inside there will be tables and benches for residents to take advantage of the Wi-Fi. Newby says the chamber plans to have it up and running by the time the children get back from their Christmas Vacation in the first semester, but that depends if the project stays on schedule. Regardless, it will continue as planned even if the chamber doesn't get a grant to help fund the project, but \"it will make it easier and quicker to do a lot of things. \" As for the rest of the programs, Newby asserts that 2023 is going to be \"extremely busy,\" and residents can look forward to new business developments in the community. For residents who want to learn more, the chamber meets at the Daniel Cowin Construction building at 2041 Jesse James Road every third Wednesday of the month. There, they can meet and greet the new businesses that are coming to their towns. \n",

      " ANDERSON--Residents congregated together to celebrate the annual Anderson Christmas parade on Thursday Dec 2. The event started at 6:30 p. m. and the people endured the cold to see the parade floats pass by on Main St. while the lights sparkled against the night sky. Local businesses and familiar names drove on by as the judges scored the floats. A lot of thought goes into judging these floats. Judging the floats were the Anderson Betterment Club. Communications Director for McDonald County Schools Ken Schutten was the emcee and one of the judges at the parade. \"So we look at several different aspects like overall appearance of the flow, the best use of light, creativity and how they use the nighttime festivities. All different kinds of things go into judging a float. \" Anderson changed the parade time to the evening. That way, they could take advantage of the night sky, which made the floats shine bright. Some of the floats that drove by were Ray's Towing service, Opaa! Food management Inc. , The McDonald County High School Marching Band, the Anderson Dance Academy and White Rock Fire Department to name a few. Also Santa and Mrs. Clause made an appearance and so did one individual who had \"a change of heart\": The grinch. Many vendors and businesses were open. Daylight Donuts, Lizzy G's Hometown BBQ and the Anderson Dance Academy. The academy was selling hotdogs, hot drinks and kettle corn too. Excitement was in the air. Children racing up and down the street catching candy while mothers bundle up their babies as the floats drove by. Fathers held their toddlers on their shoulder waving to the passersby while \"Let it Snow\" echoed down Main St. Posh-looking Welsh Corgis showed off their knit sweaters as the steam from the breaths of laughter disappeared. No matter what, the cold couldn't keep Anderson inside. \n",

      "We were greeted with a beautifully decorated sanctuary as we gathered to worship Sunday morning at Mill Creek Baptist Church. As we begin the Christmas season, we need to remember the reason. Special prayers were requested for Ralph, J. T. , Lincoln, Cleo, Wayne, Ana Lee, Susan and the Bill Dobbs family. In the adult Sunday school class, we studied Micah 7. The lesson, taught by Rick Lett, reminds us that \"the sin of our world should break the hearts of believers who should wait expectantly for God's full salvation. Believers can also celebrate God's forgiveness, compassion and faithfulness. \" The children's lesson, taught by Terry Lett, was about Jonah and the whale. Linda Abercrombie read 2 Corinthians 12:7-9 and shared the lesson, \"Don't be Afraid of Your Weaknesses. \" The Bible is full of characters who had weaknesses just as we do. Ask God to help you with them to become the person He wants you to be. Tyrel Lett asked God's blessing upon the offertory, and he and Rick served as ushers. The congregation joined in singing hymns of praise led by Susan Cory and Karen Gardner, with special music from Karen, who sang, \"How Can I Say Thanks. \" As Pastor Mark Hall finished the series on church killers last week, Sunday's message begins a new one on \"Complacency. \" He began by asking, \"If your house roof leaks, do you just sleep on the side that doesn't leak? Is that good enough and you just settle for it?\" Sunday's sermon was a message to hit our hearts about church leadership. In Acts 20:28, Paul says, \"Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. \" Brother Mark said, \"The easiest thing to be and to do is to try to be popular and liked. It is a big desire for some. As a spiritual leader, you can't sugarcoat things. We have to tell the truth or be held accountable as a church leader. It's just like wanting to hear the truth from your doctor or having termites in your house and wanting to know it. The scariest verse in the Bible is James 3:1. \"My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment. \" Brother Mark told us that in the coming weeks, we would learn how to grow in holiness and godliness. \"Swim against the current and don't settle for good enough. God is worthy of worship. Don't settle for half the pews filled up. \" Brother Mark referred to Philippians 2:12-14, \"For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure. Do all things without complaining and disputing,\" and told us that our own church goal is verse 15, which says, \"that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world. \" Brother Mark told us that if we can do this, our church will shine in the middle of a crooked and perverse world. \"We need to be spiritual preppers. Time is getting short and we need to prepare ourselves to live in these perilous times. God wants to see holiness and godliness. Does He see that in you? Do you take care of things of God first? If He isn't first, He might as well be last. Holiness is putting God first, not only on the Lord's day but every day. \" In closing, Brother Mark told us that the next few sermons would focus on what the things of God look like. \"Do they see your holiness in how you relate to others? When Jesus comes to live in our hearts, the seed of holiness is planted. Whether or not it grows is up to us. We are here to do God's work. It's not all about us. We live in a perverse and ungodly world. There are times in life that will make or break us. Our past experiences can help others. Ask God to help you to understand what holiness and godliness looks like in a perverse world. \" Our hymn of invitation was \"Trust and Obey,\" and Doug Cory gave the benediction. We invite you to Bible Study on Wednesday evenings at 7 p. m. , Sunday school at 10 a. m. , and Sunday morning worship at 11 a. m. Everyone is welcome at Mill Creek Baptist Church, located 3 miles east of Noel, just off Highway 90. -- The opinions expressed are those of the author. \n",

      " GOODMAN -- On Tuesday, Dec. 6, the city council in Goodman passed two ordinances relating to the upcoming April 2023 General Municipal Election. These pertain to the Goodman Police Department and the tax collector position. Also, residents are in the process of renovating the old First Community Bank on Main Street to turn it into a \"train-themed\" restaurant. \"Proposition Public Safety would be a 1% sales tax increase . . . and it will be solely used to fund the police department,\" said Assistant Clerk Krystal Austen. Regarding establishing a deputy tax collector position, the council voted, and the motion did not pass. Instead, the city approved Proposition A, which will make paying taxes more convenient for citizens. \"Proposition A . . . (will) go on the ballot to make the tax collector an appointed position by the council versus an elected position,\" Austen said. The goal of the tax collector being an appointed position is to make sure a tax collector will always be present while city hall is open. The plan is to have the tax collector available Monday through Friday from 7:30 a. m. to 4 p. m. This will allow \"citizens to come in and pay their taxes and receive \"Paid\" receipts versus having to wait for the tax collector to come in,\" said Austen. The mayor and the majority vote of the members of the board of aldermen will appoint this position. Citizen should mark their calendars for April 4, 2023, for the General Municipal Election. This will allow citizens to vote on these matters. Other business Todd and Loree Carver came to discuss the renovation of the old First Community Bank on Main Street. Currently, they are converting the bank into a \"train-themed\" restaurant that will serve Texas-style food such as brisket, pulled pork and other country dishes. Their goal is to preserve the essence of the bank and the history of Goodman. \"They're looking to hopefully connect with the Kansas City Railroad that does the Christmas train,\" said Austen, \"and see if they can coordinate Goodman to be a more frequent stop for that Christmas train in coordination with their business and help draw attention to the town. \" The city council also approved the payment of bills in the amount of $14,577. 51. In October, Alderman John Bunch drafted a letter relating to city ordinance violations that is to be sent out on Dec. 12. These letters will encourage citizens to \"promote self-revitalization\" on their properties on Main Street. This includes cleaning up their properties and giving attention to any other violations, such as untagged vehicles, trash piles, and overgrown yards. These letters pertain to anyone, whether it's residential or commercial, who has these violations. This will ensure our city stays nice and clean, he said. \n",

      " GOODMAN -- On Dec. 20, the city council discussed the possibility of providing the public works department animal control services the means to apprehend animals via tranquilizers. It also reviewed its policy with MOPERM and the future city budgets for the year 2023. Present at this meeting were Mayor J. R. Fisher, Alderman John Bunch, Alderman Nicholas Smith, Alderman Beth Hallmark, Alderman Clay Sexson, and assistant city clerk Krystal Austen. First on the agenda, the council considered its current status with MOPERM. According to the company's website, \"MOPERM is the number one alternative for the property and liability protection (for the) needs of Missouri public entities. \" As the end of the year approaches, so will the city's 2022 insurance policy with the company. Sexson made the motion to \"approve the MOPERM Insurance for 2023,\" and all the aldermen concurred. The public works department repaired the city's pavement buckles to prepare for the cold weather. This is important because extreme changes in weather temperatures can cause the road to expand and make it unsafe to drive. Bunch took a moment to bring up a concern he and public works director Keith Estes had about animal control. He jokingly said the \"animals do not want to participate\" and requested the purchase of tranquilizers to apprehend the animals safely without \"killing the animals. \" Bunch acknowledges the city must consult with a veterinarian to know the proper dosage of the tranquilizers and the steps needed \"to bring the animal back around. \" Hallmark raised some concerns about the liability of administering tranquilizers via darts to the animals and the potential backlash from owners of the animals. Residents may ask: Why not use catch poles or animal graspers instead of darts? \"I would not want to be close to a mad dog,\" said Fisher. And then you got to get it up into the cage. I don't want no part in that. \" The council plans to review the matter, which will include getting input from local veterinarians and evaluating the cost of training. Other Business Fisher said he is looking into the possible annexation of North Highway 59. \"That's going to be a lot of work,\" said Fisher. \"I've already got a lot of the legwork done on the first section. You got one, two, three, four, five sections. Each one has a list of all the different things that need to be done. \" \"And I'm hoping to look at . . . submitting it right at the first of the year,\" he added. In November, the police department had \"187 calls for service, 35 traffic stops, seven animal calls, 13 suspicious circumstances, and eight domestics. \" The council paid bills in the amount of $17,884. 20. The city council approved a motion to close the \"fiscal year as of Dec. 31, 2022\" and then reopen on Jan. 1, 2023. It also approved the city budgets for the 2023 fiscal year.

      " Jeff Simpson of Jeff's Auto in Jane has created The Christmas Trail at his business, located at 20953 U. S. Highway 71, directly across from Crowder College. He said he has been offering a walk-through light display since 2016, although it was not open in 2020 and 2021 due to covid. \"Christmas has always been big in our family,\" he said. He explained that it all began because his father had a lot of outdoor Christmas decorations and was no longer able to put them up every year, so he gave them to Simpson. He has added to the display over the years. The Christmas Trail was open the first three weekends in December this year, with Simpson's friends and family chipping in to sell homemade goodies like peanut brittle, rolls, bread, buckeyes, and other traditional family recipes. Simpson said the vendors sell the items at reasonable prices. Also, he gives away hot cocoa and cookies to those who come to view the decorations. Simpson said he added 17 blowup characters this year, noting he wanted to make the attraction a bit bigger since it was closed for the past two years. There is a musical light show on nights that it is open, and a nativity scene makes up part of the trail. Live characters such as Santa and Mrs. Claus, the Grinch, elves and a snowman have also been known to attend. \"It's growing. It started small and it started to grow,\" said Belinda, Simpson's wife. \"We'd like to see it grow to an attraction where more businesses build a spot, even if we have to move it to a bigger area,\" Simpson said. The Christmas Trail will not have vendors or live characters this weekend, but visitors may come on Christmas Eve and Christmas night and walk through the display, Simpson said. Next year it will be open starting the first weekend in December. \n",

      " SOUTHWEST CITY -- All down Main Street in Southwest City, residents could hear the voices of students from Southwest City Elementary School on Dec. 16, as they stopped by the various stores, businesses and offices to sing Christmas carols. The Southwest City Elementary Christmas caroling started with Mrs. Messley, who was the former principal of Southwest City Elementary School. She taught her students Christmas carols and then \"would send them out around the community on the last day before Christmas break to thank the community. \" Now, it continues to be a part of the school's tradition. Students hiked from the school to Main Street. Their first stop was the Cornerstone Bank at 117 N. Main Street. Leading the class is music teacher Stephana Wikerson. With her 40 students, they flocked into the lobby and sang classic Christmas songs like \"O Christmas Tree,\" \"Tis the Season To Be Jolly,\" and \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas. \" All the students have devoted a lot of time to practicing for the event. Wikerson cues her students and leads them like a conductor at a symphony. Onlookers turn to see who is singing. The students don their custom Christmas attire while raising their voices together in unison. The performance ends with applause for the children. While singing Christmas carols during the holiday season is a universal tradition, for Southwest City Elementary School, it goes deeper than that. Ken Schutten, communications director of McDonald County School District, commented this Christmas carol tradition is one of the few activities that brings students face-to-face with businesses in the community. Their next visit was the \"Corner Cafe and More. \" In 1922, the building where the corner cafe is located was originally a drugstore, but -- after changing hands -- now it's a cafe where customers come for the vintage setting, desserts and bakery goods. The customers there enjoyed the festive experience. \"We've never been here before, and it was cool to come in and be serenaded,\" said David Tosh. David and his wife, Tammy Tosh, are residents of Goodman. Like many other residents, they were surprised to hear the Christmas songs from these students. Cassie Blevins is one of the fourth-grade teachers at the school. She has two fourth-grade classes in her carol group, and they stopped to visit the Southwest City Library to sing a few songs. Blevins acknowledges singing carols benefits her students just as much as the residents they sing to. \"Some of these kids don't get to do things like this at home,\" said Blevins. \"And so, by . . . letting them do this, it's really nice for the kids. \" The teachers also enjoy being a part of the experience. \"I love the excitement they have whenever we line up in the classroom. We put on our Santa hats, and they're just so excited. That's the best part. \" Principal Jeff Patterson, of Southwest City Elementary School, says he thinks \"it's a great tradition\" and plans \"to carry it on. \" \"We're so thankful to be in a community that is student-oriented, and they support their school. There is so much care and compassion here because they really do turn out to help our kids and support them in every way. \" Residents of Southwest City have donated money and supplies to various programs in the school. Their generosity doesn't go unnoticed. These expressions of music and singing go to show that the school really appreciates being close to its community. \n",

      "GOODMAN -- On Dec. 20, the city council in Goodman discussed the possibility of spending funds to better the city, which could include establishing railroad \"quiet zones\" within parts of the city's limits. Members also brought to the table other potential projects that could use the funds if approved by all members of the board. The council also opened the floor to residents who had any inquiries. Present at this meeting was Mayor J. R. Fisher, Alderman John Bunch, Alderman Nicholas Smith, Alderman Beth Hallmark, Alderman Clay Sexson, and Assistant City Clerk Krystal Austen. Fisher spoke first and informed the council that he had been in contact with Moffatt & Nichol Inc. The company's website says they are a \"global infrastructure advisory firm\" that \"provides engineering and consulting services to clients in the marine terminal, transportation, energy, environmental, federal, and urban development markets around the world. \" According to Fisher, Moffatt & Nichol Inc. have been working closely with the Kansas City Southern Railway Company for various projects. One of these projects could establish \"no horn zones\" within the Goodman city area. In a \"no horn zone\" or \"quiet zones,\" railroads are directed to cease the routine sounding of their horns when they approach certain crossings. Citizens can request no horn zones if they feel the noise is too much of a disturbance, especially if near residential areas. After consulting with Moffatt & Nichol Inc. , Fisher explained that the city got a proposal that outlined the steps and fees they would incur if they followed through with the project. \"If taxpayers want to spend $40,000 on a 'no horn zone. ' I'm all in. I think it's worth it,\" said Fisher. \"I think it would raise everybody in the town's property value. \" One resident inquired about the cost of the project, feeling the amount was over-inflated. \"It's an engineering service,\" said Fisher. \"And they're just insanely expensive. Same with anything else the city tries to do. You get an engineer involved, and they're crazy expensive. \" It is estimated the project would cost the city roughly $30,000 for the engineers and $10,000 for materials. Sexson spoke up and said he had received a phone call that day from \"someone that has actually lost someone due to a no horn zone. This individual had lost his mother and sister in a train accident. \"And his point of view,\" said Sexson, \"which aligns with what I feel is, 'Is $40,000 worth it?'\" Sexson admits the train horns are a \"minor inconvenience\" but asserts it's not worth the loss of lives, even if it's \"one life over the next 50 years. \" He feels having these train horns will provide a more safe environment for the community. Bunch commented he would \"rather see the money right now be expended on some of the projects that (they have) already discussed. And then move forward on. \" He suggests the funds could be used to help the \"police department,\" \"the streets,\" and \"water-sewer projects. \" The government projects Bunch was referring to are the culverts at Whitmore and Garner Streets, for which the council agreed to use APRA funding or funding from a CD. The city has received a little over $200,000 in ARPA money. Hallmark proposed the funds could be used for solar energy. \"There's four of us here. So I like solar (energy) because, in the long run, it's going to save us money. It reduces our (carbon) footprint. It's a great idea, and it brings us up into the 21st century. \" The council discussed the solar panels at the wastewater treatment plant and agreed to move forward on that project. Before committing to how the funds will be made available, Fisher is currently seeking a grant to help with those expenses. The topic concluded with the city deciding to have an open forum to discuss these matters with the public. The meeting will be held at the Goodman Community Building at 222 E. Garner Street on Jan. 26, 2023. All are welcome. \n",

      " ANDERSON -- Everything seems to be pointing in the right direction for the McDonald County boys wrestling team heading into the 2022-23 season. The Mustangs return five state qualifiers, including three state medalists and other key contributors from last year's team. The Mustangs anticipate being able to fill its 14-slot lineup card most nights, coach Josh Factor said. The Mustangs are led by two seniors and three returning juniors. Seniors Blake Ortiz and Levi Smith are both two-time state qualifiers who both recently achieved their 100th career win. Ortiz was the 2021 state runner-up and finished in the quarterfinals last year in what was a tough weight division at 126. \"Blaine had an outstanding offseason,\" Factor said. \"He did cross country and competed in the district cross country meet. He also had a pretty eventful summer, wrestling in a tournament in Booneville, Missouri, and wrestled well in the Southern Plains Regional in Mulvane (Kan. ). . . . He's been after it. We're excited to see him work on getting back to the podium in Columbia. \" Smith was one match victory short of winning a state medal last season. \"We're hoping the third time's a charm for Levi Smith,\" Factor said. \"We're banking on that one. We're hoping his third trip to Columbia this year, he'll bring back some hardware. He's been a good leader. We're excited to see what we can bring to the mat as well. \" Junior Samuel Murphy placed third in the state last year as a sophomore in a somewhat controversial fashion. Murphy appeared to have won a victory in the 220 semifinals, only for the victory to be taken away by the rules committee. After more than a 20-minute delay, Murphy was later defeated by the eventual state champion. He did bounce back to win the third-place match. \"It's been a tremendous motivator,\" Factor said. \"Anytime you see your wrestler fall short and have a takedown taken away that cost them a (shot at wrestling for a) state championship, it's definitely heartbreaking. \" Murphy had a busy summer, wrestling all over the country, including Fargo, N. D. , Atlanta, and Las Vegas, where he earned All-American honors with a top-eight finish. \"I know he comes into the year ranked No. 15 in national rankings,\" Factor said. \"He's got a lot to offer to our program. He has high goals of winning his first state championship this year. Hopefully, we can give him the tools he needs to go make it happen. \" Junior Jayce Hitt finished fifth in the 285-pound heavyweight division. \"We've seen a lot of growth from Jayce,\" Factor said. Factor added that Hitt has benefited from McDonald County's expanded coaching staff, which added coach Reed Davis and Bo Bennett. \"Anytime we can push guys like Jayce in our coaching room, it's a good thing,\" Factor said. Both Murphy and Hitt just returned to the team after the conclusion of football season. State qualifier Jose Mendoza, who qualified in the 113-pound class, also returned to the team from the conclusion of soccer season. \"Jose Mendoza comes off a great soccer season,\" Factor said. \"I read he got all-district honorable mention honors. We're excited to have him there. He's gotten a lot of kids trying out wrestling for us. It helps having guys like him. \" Factor said Mendoza, a junior, went to the team's camp in Ohio and has become more dedicated to wrestling. \"He's stepped up and become a leader,\" Factor said. \"He's put a lot more time into the sport and really developed a lot of confidence. I like his chances to get back to state. \" Factor is looking forward to seeing other veterans perform as well. Senior Colter Vick, who was out for a year, is back to the program as a senior. \"Coming back as a senior, he has a lot to offer,\" Factor said. \"He's been involved with our youth program. We're excited to get him back. \" Huxley Wardlaw and Cross Spencer are also seniors who will contribute. Junior Ayden Ball brings a lot of experience Sophomores Malosi Sosef and Alex Bogart will play key roles, and several freshmen will get looks as well. The Mustangs will host a dual with Reeds Spring and Hillcrest at 1:30 p. m. Thursday. They'll host another Assembly Dual on Feb. 4 against Carl Junction. \"We're excited about adding another early start dual,\" Factor said. [] \n",

      " ANDERSON -- McDonald County High School JROTC students will visit McDonald County Living Center in Anderson on Dec. 10. JROTC instructor Captain Eric Corcoran said about 10 students would visit the nursing home with the goal of visiting with residents this holiday season. Kerry Gibson, a senior and four-year JROTC member, said one of the goals in attending the facility is to teach students how to care for members of the community. \"It's to help teach our cadets, our students, to give back to the community,\" Gibson said. \"Because one of these days, we'll be in that same position. So, we want them to know how to help people and build our community to be a better place than it already is. \" Gibson said this project is one of many ways JROTC can give back to the community. \"We're hoping to give back to our community in multiple ways and, hopefully, this is something that we can continue doing, and it does mean a lot to our Lieutenant Colonel as well,\" Gibson said. Gibson said this project would show how high school students can benefit the community in more ways than one. \"This teaches that high school students and minors can help out in the community just as much as any adult,\" Gibson said. \"Billionaire, poor person, it doesn't matter where your financial being is, you can still always help. Manually, financially, or however you can. \" Braden Testerman, a senior and four-year JROTC member, said JROTC students have been unable to visit McDonald County Living Center since covid-19. Testerman said he hopes JROTC students can show care and love to the residents during their visit. \"We want to show care and love in the community,\" Testerman said. \"We want to support them in their time,\" Testerman said, nodding his head. Testerman said he is excited to see the look on the residents' faces when the JROTC students come to visit. \"I'm excited to see their smiles and expressions on their faces when we're there to show our support and love to them,\" Testerman said. Jasmine Williams, a junior and two-year member of JROTC, said JROTC students chose to do this project as it's close to the high school and beneficial to the community. Williams said students in the JROTC program are working to do more in the community. Williams said this project shows student responsibility. \"This shows that we do have responsibility to do things like this,\" Williams said. \"It shows that kids do have potential in helping. This also shows that JROTC is not just a military thing. \" Williams said she hopes JROTC's nursing home project will inspire more student organizations to volunteer in the community and showcase their students' responsibility and care for residents and community improvement. \n",

      " ANDERSON -- Nicole Holder's art class at McDonald County High School is creating Christmas cards to raise funds for the benefit of the high school art club. These cards are original works of art made by her students. Each card is created using the \"block printing\" method. Holder's art class started the Christmas card project so it could fund the art club. The club has given students the opportunity to give back to the community. \"Instead of having a money (entrance) fee for the kids,\" said Holder. \"We had them bring canned goods, which we donated to the food pantry here. So whatever we sell, we're going to give back to the community through the art club. \" The Christmas card project gives students a chance to develop business skills they'll need in the real world. \"They're learning . . . the business side of things like marketing and how to think about their target audience,\" said Holder. The students arrive at the school cafeteria and set up a table that displays all the different cards they've created. Each work is original and made using the \"block printing\" method. It is a labor-intensive process that took students more than a month to finish. Holder says: \"They draw their design on a piece of paper. And then, they transfer it to a piece of rubber and carve it out like a stamp. And so, it's the reverse of what they carve, and they actually stamp it using ink and rollers. They've made all of these designs from scratch. \" Each design is unique and a reflection of the student's creativity and imagination. Some students paint a classic white Christmas, while others add comedy and satire to give a spin on the Christmas many are familiar with. Some cards use mono-tone colors. And others splash vibrant colors to make their art \"pop. \" Holder teaches art, photography and graphic design and has 16 of her students working on the Christmas card project. Two of the students are Zoey Leer and Arianna Craddock. They are the leaders in the sale project. Leer is a senior and has aspirations to be in theatre and art when she graduates. Her Christmas card is a Christmas Holly with striking red berries. The leaves are sharp and jagged with black ink. The color paint doesn't stay within the lines. And long, fast strokes of ink give the card a sense of urgency and energy. It's one of Holder's favorites. Leer enjoys working on this project. \"I was happy about the process of how we did it and how the outcome has been,\" said Leer. Arianna Craddock is a sophomore, and she also created a Christmas Card. Her style is the complete opposite of Leer's. Her card depicts Christmas ornaments with blended jewel-tone colors of blue and green. All are within the lines of the shapes. Despite the cool colors of the ornaments, it's the white backdrop of the card that brings them out. And the round shape of the ornaments, in contrast with the sharp lines on the card, adds a duality of textures and colors. For Craddock, she likes this project because of what it means. \"I like how people can get their cards easily and give them to family and friends. \" She also enjoys the level of responsibility she has within the project. All 16 of Holder's students have had a big part in the project. She looks at her students and has confidence in their future. \"I'm proud of them,\" Holder said. \"I was very nervous at first because we're putting ourselves and our art out there . . . but they've done really well. I'm so proud of them. \" \n",

      " ANDERSON -- The youth movement is in full swing for the McDonald County Lady Mustangs basketball team in 2022-23. That's good news and bad news. The bad news means the Lady Mustangs will have to overcome some challenges that await all teams that rely on young players. The good news, however, means the future is bright for girls basketball in McDonald County. \"The thing is if we can keep building, there's a very, very bright future,\" said head coach Sean Crane. \"We've got talent. Just because we're young doesn't mean we can't surprise people this year. . . . We've just got to keep building each day. \" Seniors Megan Elwood and Analisa Ramirez are back as the only upperclassmen with playing experience. Elwood (3. 6 points per game) is a three-year varsity player and a holdover from the Lady Mustangs' district title team in 2020-21. \"She's a key player for us,\" Crane said. \"She's a good leader. Megan's a good kid. You can take a hundred of Megan and you'd be all right. \" Ramirez, meanwhile, proved to be a surprise for the Lady Mustangs last year. As a junior, she was projected as a junior varsity and practice player but moved up to the varsity and played well as a role player off the bench, Crane said. Senior Alexis Abbott was lost for the season with an injury. Junior Carlee Cooper (3. 6 ppg) looks to lead the Lady Mustangs' backcourt in her third year as a varsity starter. Cooper also is a holdover from the district championship team two years ago. \"She's going to be a real important player for us,\" Crane said of Cooper. Junior guard Anna Clarkson (5. 2 ppg) showed last year as a sophomore that she can knock down the outside shot and score in bunches. But the Lady Mustangs will be asking more from her this year. \"We're going to need her to step up defensively,\" Crane said. \"She's a real important young lady. \" Junior Katelynn Townsend saw action in varsity and JV games a year ago. \"She's not very big. She's 5-foot-2 on a stack of books, but she plays hard and is a good athlete,\" Crane said. \"She's tough as nails. \" Junior Corina Holland also will get some minutes. \"She's just scrappy,\" Crane said of Holland. Carlie Martin, a freshman, also will play some guard. \"She's a good athlete that will be a pretty darn good player for us by the time it's said and done,\" Crane said. At the forwards, the Lady Mustangs will rely on a plethora of athletes after the loss of forwards Addy Leach (10 ppg, graduation) and Samara Smith (12 ppg, transfer). Seniors Elwood and Ramirez will play a role there. Sophomores Riley Anderson and Roslynn Huston don't have any varsity experience, but both have size and height. \"They're going to have to step up,\" Crane said. Jacie Frencken, a star junior softball player, will have a chance to help. Freshman Jamie Washam also is in the mix. \"She's a very athletic young lady,\" Crane said of Washam. \"She's going to be a good one. She just needs some experience. \" Crane said the Lady Mustangs are going to have to be defensive-oriented. \"That's a big thing for us,\" he said. \"We have the ability to get up and down the floor. We're athletic all the way through and we move well. For us, everything starts on the defensive end. We've got to become a good team defensively. If we do, good things will happen in the future. \" Crane said one challenge for a young team could be the pace of the game. \"The pace of the game is going to give us some issues,\" he said. \"And sometimes, flat-out experience. For some of these freshman and sophomores, things that used to work in JV and junior high levels just don't work in high school. Everything is faster. \" Crane said the Lady Mustangs are trying to bring them along the right way and not take any shortcuts. \"We're playing the long game,\" he said. \"Obviously, we want to win now, but we want to develop the right culture. The future is very bright. We've just got to get there. \" The Lady Mustangs opened the season with a 46-30 win against Springfield Hillcrest on Nov. 18, led by 13 points from Clarkson. McDonald County suffered its first loss, 54-27, against Nevada in the opening round of the CJ Classic in Carl Junction on Nov. 28. Elwood had 10 points and Cooper nine in the loss to Nevada. The Lady Mustangs bounced back to beat Seneca, 51-38, the next night on Nov. 29. Clarkson had 16 points and Martin 14 in the win over Seneca. On Thursday, Dec. 1, McDonald County lost, 45-35, to Neosho. Cooper led the Lady Mustangs with 11 points. McDonald County was back in action on Dec. 6 against Webb City. The Lady Mustangs will host Monett on Thursday, Dec. 8, before hosting the Lady Mustang Classic on Dec. 12-14. Teams participating along with McDonald County are Farmington, Webb City, Carl Junction and Arkansas teams Bentonville West, Springdale, Southside and Gentry.

      " ANDERSON -- Wyatt Hester and his students at McDonald County High School are putting together a production of \"A Christmas Carol\" at the McDonald County Performing Arts Center. This year, on Dec 9 through 11, spectators can look forward to a huge ensemble cast of characters, and Hester promises this performance will have a fresh twist on an old classic Christmas tale. Hester is the theater director of the school, and this will be the fifth annual production of \"A Christmas Carol. \" A Christmas Carol tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, who is a miser that is visited by three ghosts that help him find redemption in his life. As the story progresses, the audience witnesses Scrooge's transformation as he reflects on his life and the people that surround him. Many agree this story is the embodiment of Christmas. Hester is excited about this year's cast. \"I have over 70 advanced kids besides all the freshmen and drama kids,\" said Hester. \"And there are three of them that I have cast as Scrooge, and they are exceptional. \" The students playing Scrooge are Jacob Winkler, who Hester says \"leads the pack. \" And Peyton Nalley and Sam Brewer, who are \"excellent. \" Since the beginning, Sam Brewer has always had a part in the play. Starting with minor roles, he rose up the ranks until now he plays the leading role of Scrooge. Peyton Nalley is also playing Scrooge. He has applied to Juilliard, and the school of arts has expressed interest and requested he auditions to see if he would make a good fit for the school. Hester comments that their skills as actors shine as they express the emotions and feelings of the character. It's essential because the actors need to have an understanding of a character that continues to develop from start to finish. He begins the story as a miserable, angry man that becomes a compassionate and generous human being. While the main protagonist of the story is Scrooge, Hester has experimented with the character and has even changed the narrative of the story. \"We do a different twist every year. Like one year, we had a lady scrooge, and another year it was from Marley's perspective. \" The character, Jacob Marley, was Scrooge's former business partner who had passed away seven years prior to when the story takes place. He is depicted wearing chains and is the first ghost to warn Scrooge of the other three ghosts that will arrive to help him on his way to redemption. This is something that Marley himself never had the chance to experience. This year, the story will be \"told through the eyes of Belle,\" who was Scrooge's former fiance. Scrooge and Belle fell in love, but eventually, their engagement fell apart because of Scrooge's obsession with material wealth. This change in perspective adds depth to the character and allows the actors to explore a part of Scrooge's life through the eyes of a woman that once loved him. Hester took a moment to thank the principal of McDonald County High School. \"Angie brewer is amazing. She makes things happen. She's a mover and shaker. This program, this production, the whole nine yards would not be there without her. . . . She's excellent. \" For residents who wish to see these performances, tickets are available. Tickets purchased in advance are $8 and can be bought at the high school office. Tickets to the door are $10, and children's tickets are always $5. The scheduled performances will start at 7 p. m. on Friday, Dec. 9, and Saturday, Dec. 10. Then on Sunday, Dec 11, the show starts at 2 p. m. \"We had an excellent show last year; it just continues to get better and better. . . . The more you do something, the more you can add to it and make it better,\" said Hester. No doubt, this performance will give audiences a fresh look at a timeless classic. \n",

John Kelsh of Veregy said the company has been hard at work putting bids together and is having great results with lots of bids from local companies. He also added construction costs are not going down and there will be increases at the beginning of next year. He said the company should know the final price on Dec. 20 for bundle one. Bundle one includes Pineville Primary shelter, White Rock shelter, Rocky Comfort shelter, Pineville Elementary addition, Southwest City classroom addition. Bundle two includes Noel Elementary shelter, Anderson Elementary shelter, Anderson Middle School shelter. He said he expects the budget to come in at a range of $29 million to $30 million, and they need to come up with a plan to reduce costs. Superintendent Mark Stanton said that, in the bond issue voters passed, the board stated it wanted safe shelters. He said Rocky Comfort Elementary School and White Rock Elementary School do not have anything like that and asked if the company could provide a price for just the storm shelter for those two sites. \"The most important thing was providing a safe place for kids,\" he said. He later added, \"That's a big number, and it's a number the district doesn't have. \" During the board meeting, the board: \n",

      " PINEVILLE -- Associates with Walmart joined officials with the McDonald County Historical Society, Eastern Commissioner Jamey Cope, and State Representative Dirk Deaton (R-Noel) at the historic courthouse and museum in Pineville to present a check for $10,000 to the McDonald County Historical Society. Walmart's great support of the Historical Society was acknowledged. It was also noted that there are a number of Walmart Associates who regularly volunteer at the museum. The gift from Walmart was made towards the Historical Society's \"Make the Match\" campaign. This campaign was started by the Historical Society earlier this year after Representative Deaton helped to secure a grant in the state budget to assist with the historic preservation efforts, including improvements to the historic McDonald County courthouse in Pineville that now serves as the museum. The $100,000 state grant became available as a part of a pandemic-related relief bill. The Historical Society suffered from the pandemic in various ways, but perhaps none more than the inability to hold annual fundraising banquets for two consecutive years: 2020 and 2021. As a result, there was a lengthy unmet backlog of deferred maintenance, including but not limited to leaking windows, warped doors and crumbling sidewalks. The state grant requires matching funds, which is the reason for the \"Make the Match\" campaign.

Hardridge said she started in the district by teaching junior high English in Noel. Hardridge has taught in Noel and Southwest City. Hardridge worked as an elementary counselor in Southwest City, a high school counselor, and worked as the high school assistant principal. For the last seven years, Hardridge has worked in the district's central office. Hardridge said that, after her retirement, she looks forward to spending more time with her family and more time traveling. Although Hardridge looked back on many accomplishments through the years, she said weathering covid-19 was one of the largest challenges she had to overcome in her position. \"While being assistant superintendent, we weathered covid,\" Hardridge said with a sigh. \"That was the biggest challenge, getting through that. I'm happy that we were able to, after the year when the pandemic shut everything down, keep the schools open the next year. That was by far the biggest challenge that I faced. \" Hardridge said she would miss her co-workers and her \"building family\" she has worked with over the last 30 years. \"I've worked with these people for 30 years, so they're family,\" Hardridge said. \"They've been with me through the great times, through sad times. Not seeing them every day, not being in and out of the schools -- you know, 30 years, and I went to school here, so these buildings are so familiar and comfortable. It's what I love. And I'll miss being around the kids. \" Hardridge said the advice she has for the next assistant superintendent is to listen twice as much as you speak. Hardridge noted the district would change a lot with a new superintendent and assistant superintendent, but she's looking forward to what the district has in store. \"It's always nice to have a fresh start, and I think it'll be exciting to see what new ideas and new directions a new team brings in,\" Hardridge said. \n",

      " PINEVILLE -- On Monday evening, Jane Walmart was lined with law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency management members, and more heroes to offer McDonald County children a Christmas shopping experience. Two hundred thirty-eight children were invited to participate in the program, more than in prior years. Children participating in \"Shop with a Hero\" were chosen by their schools, with each school in the county, including head start, placing nominations. Homeschooled children or children younger than the age of three were nominated by parents through an application process. Nearly two hundred forty children were chosen, with children under three years old allotted about $70 to spend in Walmart, and children four and older allotted about $100. On Monday, 131 children shopped, with 110 more expected on Tuesday. On the first night of the program, 64 \"heroes\" from various county agencies shopped with children, with about 40 expected the second night. Lieutenant Michael Hall, the event organizer, said funds for the program were raised through various donations, fundraisers, school fundraisers, and a Walmart community grant. This year $25,371. 84 was raised. Hall said various county agencies were represented, noting the program's growth since its start as \"Shop with a Cop\" in 2005. \"We had 64 or so firemen, policemen, rescue, dispatch -- emergency services all around,\" Hall said. \"We also had search and rescue, the four-state area search and rescue dogs. I invite every fire department, police department, the sheriff's office, conservation, highway patrol, dispatchers, emergency management, and any soldiers that are around. \" Hall said heroes help children find items they need, such as winter coats and shoes first, then help the children pick out anything else they'd like to buy. Restrictions on purchases include violent video games and movies, shopping cards, phone cards, cell phones, or any kind of weapon. Hall said there is nothing quite like seeing the children's faces after they've purchased their items. \"We love to see the kids' faces,\" Hall said, \"and the interaction between the first responder and the kids . . . and we just want the kids to have a good Christmas. \" Conor Jones, McDonald County juvenile officer, said he participated in \"Shop with a Hero\" this year to give back to the community. \"This is a way to give back to the community and help the kids in need who may not have the best financial situation,\" Jones said. \"That way, they can have all the gifts and the things they need this winter. \" Jones said shopping with the children makes them feel more comfortable around law enforcement and enforces the fact that local \"heroes\" want to help take care of children in the community. Jones said, while shopping, one of the children he was helping was speechless when told he could spend $100 on himself. \"There were many times when kids were picking out items, and then they'd put them back and say, 'I don't know if I can get that,'\" Jones said. \"And we kept reassuring them, 'There's a limit, and we want you to reach it,' and they were just speechless at times more than anything. It seemed like they were just overwhelmed with joy and happiness, which was awesome. \" Jones said he was happy to be able to spend time with the kids and help them shop. Jones added that he was happy to see so many McDonald County agencies working together to aid the community. Hall said one of his favorites scenes of the night was a child with a pair of rollerblades clung tightly to his chest as he was leaving the store. Hall noted he had bags in tow but kept the rollerblades close with a smile on his face. \n",

Nalley said after Beachner shared the news with him, the two went to tell principal Angie Brewer, who shed tears of excitement. Nalley said he feels he has the artistic merit to go to Juilliard, but before his audition request, he didn't know if Juilliard was a real option for him. \"I have the artistic merit that Juilliard calls for,\" Nalley said. \"I've always been interested in acting, but I never knew that it would be a possibility. I never would really feel lucky enough to do it, until recently. \" Nalley said what he deems a \"recent reality\" won't be an easy feat, noting the school has a 7% acceptance rate, sitting amongst other highly competitive colleges like Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania. Nalley's audition, which will be on Jan. 14, has several components. \"For my audition, it calls for me to do four monologues -- one of them has to be Shakespearean,\" Nalley said. \"I am going to do two other contemporary monologues, and I have to do a song acapella. \" Nalley, who has never been to New York, said the opportunity to audition for such a prestigious school is an opportunity he treasures, noting the rarity that it is. \"I think the fact that I'm able to go to Juilliard and audition, let alone the fact that I might be able to get in, and being able to go to New York in the first place is something that's very special,\" Nalley said. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because not too many people get to do this, and it's really exciting. \" Nalley noted he has received immense support from several of his friends, as well as staff at MCHS, including Lisa Wallis, Theresa Walthall, and Wyatt Hester. Nalley said, above all, that he is excited. But he's also terrified at the prospect of moving from his home in Anderson to New York. \"I have to change how I thought my life was going to be,\" Nalley said. \"It is very exciting, but it's also kind of terrifying as well. \" \n",

      " PINEVILLE -- The Pineville Board of Aldermen, at its meeting Tuesday, voted to give Pineville water customers a $10 rebate on their water bill so they can run a steady stream of water to keep their pipes from freezing during the extremely cold temperatures starting tonight and going through this weekend. Mayor Gregg Sweeten said on Thursday night, that on Friday and Saturday, there would be life-threatening wind chills, and public works superintendent Chris Tinsley told him the city should have people run their faucets on more than a drip so their pipes do not freeze. The board voted to give a $10 rebate on customers' January water bills so they could run their faucets without fear of the cost. Tinsley said, \"If it does what they say, things will freeze that have never frozen before. A drip isn't enough . . . it needs to hit a steady stream. \" He said residents should run their faucets Thursday night, Friday and Saturday, turning them off Sunday morning. Also on Tuesday, the board voted to hold an election on the question of appointing a police chief. Sweeten said the issue of appointing a police chief rather than electing a marshal has been on the ballot a couple of times, and the last time it was turned down narrowly. He said a candidate has to be a certified peace officer to be elected marshal. Alderman Connor Underwood said a candidate for marshal has to live within the city limits, which narrows the pool of candidates. Alderman Scott Dennis said there are only two cities with marshals in the state -- Pineville and Noel. The board accepted a bid from CARDS Holding for sanitation for the city. Sweeten said the board reviewed the bids from a few companies and then sent out a survey \"because we didn't want the decision to be taken lightly. \" He said CARDS was the lowest bid and, based on the survey, he believed that was the best option. Sweeten told the board that property and vehicle insurance expenses had increased significantly. The old plan was $32,857, and the new plan was $44,268 if the city raised its deductibles to $10,000 and $47,797 if it did not raise the deductibles. He said there are companies willing to quote prices, but the city needs the insurance in the meantime. He said he and Clerk Melissa Ziemianin suggested keeping the current plan for the first quarter and giving the other companies time to bid. The board approved this plan. Awards were presented for the annual Christmas light contest. Angela Cawood received first place, and Autumn Hottinger received second place. Bumper to Bumper Auto received the traveling trophy for the winning business. In other business, the board: \n",

      "GOODMAN -- The Goodman Police Department took a moment to surprise residents with gifts from this year's \"Secret Santa Stop\" on Dec. 20. This was the second annual event for the department, and, with Police Chief Adam Miller taking the lead, it was a great success. The officers on patrol with Miller were Officer Prestyn Kalgren, Officer Carter Graue and Officer Paul Buckner. For the Secret Santa Stop, officers in McDonald County would pull over residents. But instead of getting citations, neighbors would get a surprise. Miller says, \"It's always a cool and fun element of surprise. People will get pulled over by the police for doing absolutely nothing wrong. Once we introduce ourselves and let them know what we're out here doing . . . it goes from them wondering why they're being pulled over to just an overall fun experience for everybody involved. \" The officers gave gifts to the children and their families. They stocked each police unit with toys such as \"Transformers\" action figures, Barbies, Nerf toys, and other play sets. The officers enjoyed themselves because they got to connect with their fellow neighbors and just have fun. Miller acknowledges that all this was possible because of the collaboration and efforts of Dollar General, the Anderson Police Department, and the community. Before the event, the department had set up donation boxes at the entrance of Dollar General. There, residents could make a donation, and the department would collect the toys. To say it was a success would be an understatement. \"They had a bunch of toy donations, and they were able to help us out with some of the overflow of toys that they had received. \" Outside the police department, there is a \"blessing locker\" where residents are welcome to drop off any donations they have, such as non-perishable food items, clothes, and toys. \"We really just love giving back to the community, especially when it comes to the kids. I really enjoy focusing on the kids. The Secret Santa Stop isn't just about giving gifts on Christmas, it's about connecting with the community and reassuring citizens that police are here to support and keep their city safe -- all the while having fun!\n",

      "The Noel Woman's Club held its meeting on Dec. 13 and it was the Christmas Party. There was no business discussed as members and guests focused entirely on the party. Thirteen members were welcomed along with two guests. Louine Gardner was hostess and planned an enjoyable time for everyone. After reciting the Lord's Prayer attendees enjoyed a potluck meal where all ate too much. Each member brought a small gift for the gift exchange and after playing a short game each person selected a gift. The club sponsored an entry in the Noel Christmas Parade and extended thanks to Linda Jefferson for providing her PT Cruiser convertible and decorations. The theme of the entry was based on the movie \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" chosen because of the small town setting of the movie and the small town living of the actual club members The car was decorated with bells and lights and included a real-life angel, Becca Balaun dressed as an angel who made her wings and dressed in period costume. Regular business meetings will resume in January. Anyone interested in becoming a member should call Club President Hannah Barthlomew at 417-475-7422 for more information.

      " ANDERSON -- Freeman Health System installed the last telemedicine unit for the McDonald County School District at Anderson Middle School on Tuesday. Now the district has a unit at every school, allowing students and staff members to have a virtual visit with a provider without leaving the school. Freeman has been working toward the goal of equipping all schools with the units since last year. Freeman School Health Coordinator Rhonda Warren said the first unit was installed in 2021 at Anderson Elementary. Four or five years ago, Rocky Comfort Elementary received a telemedicine unit. However, it was not nearly as user-friendly as the current ones that have been installed in all schools, she said. \"We're very happy that we've been able to get this program with this equipment available. There was a grant that allowed us to purchase the equipment,\" she said. The district is approaching 150 telemedicine visits for this school year so far, whereas last year, there were about 110 for the whole year, she said. The units have the capability to connect virtually with a health care provider, school nurse, and parent on a video call. The school nurse or health aid conducts the exam using various instruments that allow the provider to hear the patient's heart, see in their ears and throat or look up close at abrasions. Anderson Middle School Health Aid Samantha Martinez said some parents simply cannot leave work but want to be involved in their child's visit. Warren said the units are also helpful for staff members, especially now when it is so difficult to find substitute teachers. If patients do not have insurance, a low-cost, flat fee will apply for the visit; and for staff members, their insurance will allow for a low office visit copay, Warren said. Martinez said, \"I'm excited. I think it's going to be a benefit to the school and the students here. I think once the students see it, they're going to be like, 'What's that?'\" Warren said that, for one group of parents, the units are a convenience. For example, she said, if a student is at the high school and the parent is working in Southwest City, rather than have to drive to Anderson to pick up the student and then drive to Neosho to the doctor, the family may have a telemedicine visit. \"How much time and money did we save them?\" she said. Other parents, however, are struggling. And, for them, the units are a big help. She said the area is truly a healthcare \"desert\" because of the need to drive so far for a doctor or urgent care. She said her next step is to work with employers such as Tyson and Simmons to allow employees to take time on their breaks to join the telemedicine visits via their smartphones, so they do not have to leave the workplace. This benefits both the employee by not losing wages and the employer by not losing productivity, she said. The child can stay at school and have a prescription ordered by the provider during the visit, she said. Keeping students in school longer is another benefit of the program, she said. \n",

      " ANDERSON -- At Anderson's monthly city meeting, held Dec. 20 at Anderson City Hall, the mayor and council discussed several monthly reports, an ordinance, and pay. Police Chief David Abbott noted two Anderson police officers resigned last month, leaving the department with no designated night-shift officers. Officers have adjusted to a 24-hour coverage model until the vacant positions can be filled. Fire Chief David Abbott has looked at two bids for electric fire extrication equipment. Abbott said he does not currently want to purchase a full set, which would cost between $25,000 and $29,000, depending upon the bid pursued. Abbott wants to purchase a tool for $11,200, with a lifetime warranty. The board approved the purchase. For the utility report, it was noted that several water service installations had taken place recently. The department is also looking into some pipes being relined due to damage. The department has been working with Anderson Engineering on GTS mapping in the city. The department has been preparing for the upcoming severe winter weather. In the summer ball report, it was noted that a truss company would be donating all the trusses for the building being built at Anderson's Ball Park. A block company offered to donate labor to install the blocks, the city would be responsible for materials. The department must have the concrete pad poured before blocks can be started. In old business, the council discussed the possible purchase of an electronic sign for the city. It was decided the decision would be tabled until next month, allowing the mayor and council to connect with Anderson Betterment Club to discuss their interest in purchasing the sign with the city. Under new business, an ordinance relating to upholding Anderson sidewalk improvement initiatives was read twice and passed by the board. The board also voted to pass premium pay for full-time employees from the designated ARPA funds. Each qualifying employee will receive $1,500, with $25,836 to be spent in total. Christmas bonuses for some part-time city personnel were approved, with personnel receiving $350. Eleven employees will receive Christmas bonuses. The city voted to pay $2,000 toward its Arvest line of credit. The city heard from a concerned citizen on an obstructed view on Ceder and Grandview, with the citizen noting drivers cannot see past a resident's fence to pull onto the street safely. The city discussed implementing mirrors to assist drivers in seeing past the fencing. A letter will be sent to the homeowner regarding the issue from Mayor Wilson. In other business, the council approved paying bills in the amount of $119,519. 21. \n",

      "PINEVILLE -- River Ranch Resort, located in Noel, offered a free holiday dinner and clothing drive for community members on Dec. 23. The local business saw about 200 community members take part in the event. James King, River Ranch Resort bus driver, manager and coordinator for the event, said his boss challenged the business's managers to take on a community service project. King said this was his vision. \"All the service projects had to be different, so I figured, 'It's around Christmas time,' so we dived right in, and we went ahead and did free dinner and clothes drive for the community,\" King said. King said local businesses and individuals donated funds, food, and clothing for the event. King added that employees also helped by making sides for the dinner. \"It was your traditional Christmas dinner,\" King said. \"We had a bunch of ham, turkey, sausage, red beans and rice, cheesy potato casserole, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, apple pie, blackberry cobbler, and Christmas cookies. \" King said he chose this project because he knows that some community members may not have a place to go for the holidays. \"I know how hard it is,\" King said. \"There are people who don't have a place to go on Christmas or don't have a place to stay and eat a warm meal. I figured if we could do that for some people, that would just be the best thing ever. \" King said he is thankful for his team at River Ranch Resort and all the work they put in to make his community service project come to life. King added that this was the first year for the project but that the business plans to host a free Christmas dinner and clothing drive again next year. \"The goal was to see everybody come together,\" King said. \"It was non-discriminatory or anything, and it was beautiful. The whole community really came together. \"\n",
